title: '1.6.18 & 1.6.19 Releases'
description: 'Config panel enhancements, XP Tracker drag-and-drop reordering, Farming contract indicators'
author: Jordan
---

We've added a number of enhancements to our config panel! Busy settings panels populated with many
options now have their options split into sections which can be expanded or contracted so you can
quickly find the options you're looking for. Individual settings can also be reset to their default
values by clicking on their labels and selecting the "Reset" menu option.

Additionally, you can click the dropdown button of the config panel search bar to see a list of
common plugin categories to search.

The [XP Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) now supports drag and
drop reordering in the panel so you can reorder your skills to your liking. Thanks to
[@Shingyx](https://github.com/Shingyx) for this great enhancement.

The [Time Tracking plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Time-Tracking) now displays a
farming contract indicator next whatever crop is currently assigned as your farming contract, and can show an infobox with the crop name and state. Thanks
to [@melkypie](https://github.com/melkypie) for this feature.
