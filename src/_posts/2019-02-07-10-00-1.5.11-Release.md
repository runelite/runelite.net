title: '1.5.11 Release'
description: 'Discord party integration'
author: Adam

This release adds Discord party integration with the new party plugin. Click
"Ask to join" on a friend's profile to request to join a party. The party plugin
shows an overlay with party members' hitpoints and prayer:

![party-overlay](/img/blog/1.5.11-Release/party-overlay.png)

Allows pinging tiles via shift click:

And shows where your party members are on the world map:

The base of the party plugin is exciting and will let us build neat features in
the future such as a party damage overlay.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Update raids scouter plugin for the new rotations added in
  [last week's update](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/chambers-of-xeric-kebos-and-collection-log-changes?oldschool=1)
- Fix MLM ore counter overlay sometimes counting ores twice
- Add Amethyst crafting to the idle notifier plugin
- Fix slayer plugin to recognize flesh crawler tasks
- Add Kebos wieldable rods to fishing plugin
- Fix Zeah magic tree locations on the world map

Enjoy!
