The [Status Bars plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Status-Bars) has seen a touch-up
as you can now choose between hit points, prayer points, special attack energy, or run energy for
your left and right bars. Additionally, the heart icon for the hit points bar changes colors based
on your poison status, just like is done in the [Poison
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Poison). Thanks to
[@Malfuryent](https://github.com/Malfuryent) for further enhancing this plugin!

Colorblind options have been added to the [GPU
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU) to assist users who have common types of color blindness.
Thanks to [@benpoulson](https://github.com/benpoulson) for porting
[@ofidaner's](https://github.com/ofidaner) colorblindness correction filters for use in RuneLite!

We have [opened a merch store](https://merch.runelite.net) where you can purchase shirts,
sweatshirts, and mugs bearing the RuneLite logo to show your support.

An updated launcher was released yesterday to fix an issue preventing RuneLite
from maximizing correctly on hidpi displays on Windows, where it would not take
up the full screen. If you have thie issue, download the newer launcher (version 2.1.5)
from [runelite.net](https://runelite.net).

The website's [Plugin Hub listing](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub) can now sort plugins by their
update time or the time they were added in addition to by name and number of active installs.

We are aware the raids scouter is broken with the new large map pools from today, and will work on fixing it for a later update.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The League Chat Icons plugin has been removed, as it now exists in the vanilla client.
- [XP Globes](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Globes) can now be stacked vertically,
  using the same method to flip their orientation as infoboxes (shift and right-click).
- We have removed our website's XP tracker in favor of pointing to Wise Old Man, a tracker [created
  and maintained by Psikoi, a RuneLite contributor](https://github.com/psikoi). The [XP Tracker
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) has been updated accordingly.
- The Volcanic mine and Nightmare totem game overlays have been updated to be [moveable with our
  overlay system](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/General-Features#moving-overlays)
- League relics modifying your XP rates and health regeneration rates are now accounted for in the
  [XP Tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) and [Regeneration
  Meter](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Regeneration-Meter) plugins respectively
- You can check your league points using the newly-added `!lp` command. Other chat commands have been
  updated to reference the leagues hiscores when used on league worlds
- The new league home/minigames teleport animation will now trigger the appropriate [teleport
  timer](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers)
- Skilling plugins such as [Fishing](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Fishing),
  [Mining](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mining), and
  [Woodcutting](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Woodcutting) will show the proper activity
  status when using the new League infernal tools
- [Ground items](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Items) now have their overlays
  at the proper height for items placed on surfaces that are not ground-height, such as on tables
- [Chat Timestamps](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Timestamps) are now shown for all
  types of chat
- The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key can now be remapped with the [Key Remapping
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Key-Remapping)
- Sourhogs are now recognized as a task by the [Slayer
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer). Additionally, Cyclops are now
  recognized as an alternative monster for Hill giant tasks
- The [Menu Entry Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) now
  offers swaps for the Prayer book's "Recite-prayer" option and withdraw/deposit swaps for Chambers
  of Xeric storage chests
- The progress of your compost bins is now shown in the [Time Tracking
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Time-Tracking)
- Your [cannon ground overlay](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Cannon) is no longer shown
  if you are on a different world than the one where your cannon was placed
- Kourend task and unlock locations and Wilderness slayer cave entrances now have added tooltips via
  the [World Map plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map)
- Your anisotropic filtering setting is no longer reset to 0 when toggling the [GPU
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU)
- Item overlays are now shown for items in trade and duel inventory screens
- The [Time Tracking plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Time-Tracking) better handles
  your contract state for crops with health checks, and for diseased or dead crops
- Your [XP Tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) goal time now has several
  format options
- You can now hide dark manuscripts in the [Kourend Library
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Kourend-Library). Additionally, the Varlamore
  Envoy book is no longer shown when not completing the Depths of Despair quest (as it cannot be
  obtained otherwise), and searching a bookcase where it would be no longer resets your library
  rotation information
- You can now configure the [Discord plugin's](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord)
  time to display total time ingame, time elapsed for your current activity, or hidden entirely
- The [Motherlode Mine plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Motherlode-Mine) now shows
  an overlay on broken water wheel struts, and can display collected ores and gems as icons rather
  than as text
- The Nightmare Zone's overload potion timer and notification are now properly cleared when leaving
  the minigame
- Chronicle charges are now tracked via the [Item Charges
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Charges)

Enjoy!
