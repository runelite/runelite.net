title: '1.3.2 Release'
description: 'Movable overlays, revamped clue scoll plugin, and tithe farm plugin'
author: Adam

Movable overlay support is finally here! This allows you to move any RuneLite 
Overlay to any position on the screen. Hold alt to do so. There are 4 (or 5 on 
resizable) "snap corners" provided where, if you move an overlay to a snap 
corner, the client will dynamically place the overlay to not draw on top of 
other overlays. Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for this 
feature.

The clue scroll plugin has been rewritten, and now supports all clue types.
Thanks to [@devLotto](https://github.com/devlotto) for their work on this.

A tithe farm plugin was added by [@Unmoon](https://github.com/unmoon), which tracks plant growth stages and state.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* The instance map plugin maps now look the same as the ingame minimap
* Mouse tooltips were moved to the bottom right corner of the mouse, and are now
  hidden when the game has a tooltip open.
* Fixed slayer points and streak being lost on restart
* A kingdom of Miscellania plugin has been added to show you your support, and
  optionally warn if it is unpopular
* The raids points interface has been replaced with an overlay that also
  includes party size. As with the other overlays, this is now movable.
* Antipoison and superantipoision were added to the timers plugin
* Add holy wrench effect to itemstats plugin
* Sort infoboxes by plugin and priority
* Add Silver sickle(b) to menu swapper plugin
* Expand list of skill abbreviations for the !lvl command
* Add spicey stew to item stats plugin
* Add cave horror cannon spot
* Fix lizardmen cannon spot

Enjoy!
