title: '1.5.2 Release'
description: 'UI scaling for GPU, color banding, and expanded outer zoom limit'
author: Adam
---

Stretched mode combined with the GPU plugin will now scale the UI independently
of the rest of the game (the game is left unscaled). Thanks to
[@dbolya](https://github.com/dbolya) for this great contribution.

The GPU plugin now shades more similarly to the CPU renderer by default. You can
turn on the previous behavior by enabling the 'Smooth banding' option in the GPU
plugin settings.

The camera zoom plugin now has a configurable outer zoom limit, which controls
how far the ingame zoom can zoom out.

GPU fixes for this week:

- Fix texturing for volcanic whips, Fountain of Rune, closed bank booths, and others.
- Fix screenshots with stretched mode.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix pasting on the login screen on OSX
- Fix observatory shortcut highlight
- Fix slayer plugin not working on the first assigned slayer task
- Add Ivandis Flail to prayer plugin
- Fix the world map plugin to not noticibly drop FPS when the map is open
- Fix freeze timer not showing when you move on the same tick as being frozen
- Fix incorrect slayer kills remaining count in xp tracker

Enjoy!
