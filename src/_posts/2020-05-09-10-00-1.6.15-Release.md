title: '1.6.14 Release'
description: 'MacOS GPU rasterizer and configurable XP tracker labels'
author: Jordan
---

The [GPU plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU) now supports rasterization on MacOS! Users using Mac OSX
should notice significant performance improvements with the GPU plugin on; we have seen 20+ FPS as well as lower CPU
utilization. Due to limitations of OpenGL on MacOS the plugin does not offer extended draw distance at this time. We
plan to continue development of the plugin to add extended draw distance support on MacOS in the future.

The [XP Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) now allows customizing the labels on
the tracker boxes both in the sidebar panel and on the ingame overlays. Additionally, the progress bar can be configured
to show percentage to goal, or time to goal. Thanks to [@while-loop](https://github.com/while-loop) for adding this
enhancement!

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- We have removed the option to hide the [NPC Aggression Timer
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/NPC-Aggression-Timer)'s overlay hint so it is clearer to users what
  must be done to get the plugin working
- The [Chambers of Xeric plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chambers-of-Xeric) now continues to scout
  unknown rooms when loading new areas
- The [Loot Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) can now hide unwanted loot events
- You can now right-click chat messages to copy them to your clipboard using the [Chat History
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-History)
- Clue scrolls will now always stack when recorded in the [Loot Tracker
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker)
- The [World Map plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map) has seen several additions, such as
  tooltips for dungeon names, hunter areas, fishing spots, and agility courses
- Barbarian fish have been added to the agility [skill
  calculator](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skill-Calculator)
- The ending door of the penguin agility course is now highlighted via the [Agility
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility)
- [Teleblock timers](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) are now correctly added when playing with the
  transparent chatbox enabled
- The [Loot Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) now has options to display chat
  messages after NPC and/or PVP kills
- Some [clue scroll](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) locations and descriptions have been updated
- A bug was fixed causing the ground items menu color to sometimes not match the overlay color
- An acorn emoji has been added to the [Emoji plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Emojis)
- The [Item Stats plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Stats) has learned the correct healing amount
  for castle wars bandages while wearing the castle wars bracelet
- New [POH icons](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Player-owned-House) have been added for Weiss and Troll
  stronghold teleport portals

Enjoy!
