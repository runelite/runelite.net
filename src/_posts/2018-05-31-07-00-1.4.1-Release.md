Chat color for each chat type (public, private, clan, trade, etc.) are now
configurable in the "Chat Colors" configuratrion.

The woodcutting plugin now can overlay redwood tree locations.

The grand exchange plugin can now notify you when something buys or sells.

Also a special thanks to [@Matthew Steglinski](https://github.com/sainttx) who
contributed Javadoc for [155
files](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/3236) in the API. This greatly
improves our [published Javadoc](https://static.runelite.net/api/runelite-api/).

Screen markers can now be assigned names, making it easy to save and reuse them
later without having to re-add and position them. Existing screen markers will
need to be deleted and readded.

Full screen mode was added and is toggleable in RuneLite settings.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* Fix hiscore lookup autocomplete
* Fix hiscore and GE lookups getting stuck when given invalid input
* Improve boss timer spawn timers by start them when the NPC despawns instead of
  at the beginning of the death animation
* Add miscellaneous and scroll teleports to the world map plugin
* Skill calculator now turns actions that will become available before target
  level orange
* The bank evaluator plugin now includes the price of untradeable items
  tradeable versions
* Optimize clickbox calculation code
* Fix Vet'ion boss timer and add KQ boss timer
* Add option to swap "interact" with "empty" on birdhouses
* Update menu swapper to support multiple fairy ring defaults
* Fix slayer plugin to work with NPC contact
* Add Bandit Camp fishing spot to fishing plugin
* Fix MLM plugin when it is started/stopped from within the MLM
* Fix UI responsiveness when closing skill calculator
* Add Limestone attack stone to skill calc
* Reset gorillas in demonic gorilla plugin on startup and world hop
* Add gilded altar to idle notifier
* Add wine making to idle notifier
* Add option to swap minecart menu option to travel from GE to Keldagrim
* Add bar dispenser clickbox overlay to blast furnace plugin
* Show clickbox of the Boiler in Dorgesh-Kaan agility course in the agility
  plugin

Additionally, there were clue fixes from Eadgars-Ruse, Jordan Atwood, and Maiddog.

Enjoy!
