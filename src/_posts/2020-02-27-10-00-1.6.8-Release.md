Bank tags can now be searched in the GE:

The world map now has tooltips for mining site locations which shows which rocks are there:

The blast furnace overlay now includes the time until the coffer runs out of GP:

The GPU plugin now includes additional UI scaling options which can result in clearer images on higher resolution displays.
If you were using the stretched mode plugin with the `Increased performance mode` option _and_ the GPU plugin,
you may want to change the GPU UI scaling option to `Nearest`.

The plugin hub has a new [webpage](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub) which shows all of the plugins available on it.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- GE buy limits are now automatically pulled from the wiki
- The item stats plugin can now show item stats when hovering items in the bank
- The pensive emoji has been added to the emoji plugin (`V_V`)
- Item price tooltips now work in the seed vault
- Inventory tags now has 2 additional tag groups
- Fix the loottrackker show/hide ignored loot button
- Fix the always stack resizable stones interface styles option
- Add bounty hunter (rogue) and LMS chat commands
- Fix incorrectly hiding salamander attack styles with the attackstyles plugin

Enjoy!
