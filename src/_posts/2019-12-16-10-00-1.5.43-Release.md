title: '1.5.43 Release'
description: 'Camera plugin right-click rotate, clan chat confirm kick dialog, and bugfixes'
author: Jordan
---

The newly-renamed [Camera plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Camera) now offers an
option to rotate the camera using your right mouse button when no menu options are available. It
also offers further options to map the middle mouse button to open the right-click menu and to
ignore the "Examine" menu option for right-click camera rotation. Thanks to
[@Wynadorn](https://github.com/Wynadorn) for this contribution!

The [Clan Chat plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clan-Chat) now has an option to
display a chat prompt to confirm kicking a player to help avoid accidental kicks! Thanks to
[@TheStonedTurtle](https://github.com/TheStonedTurtle) for this feature.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [Chat Commands plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Commands)'s chatbox
  clearing keybinds are now configurable
- The [Kourend Library plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Kourend-Library) has an
  option (enabled by default) to display a tutorial overlay to help get started with it
- Messages displayed via the [Twitch plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Twitch) now
  have timestamps
- Captain Khaled and Arceuus library customers now have [menu entry
  swaps](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) for their "Task" and "Help"
  options, respectively
- A [menu entry swap](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) for previous
  destinations of your POH Jewellery box has been added
- The "Chat Leagues Icons plugin" has been renamed to the easier-to-understand [League Chat Icons
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/League-Chat-Icons)
- League Chat icons no longer display usernames without their appropriate [chat
  colors](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Color) applied
- The [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) has learned to recognize
  Konar giving a player their first slayer task in the Twisted League
- The [Object Markers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Object-Markers) now properly
  allows unmarking objects which may have a different name than when they spawned

Enjoy!
