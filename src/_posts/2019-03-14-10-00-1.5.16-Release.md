title: '1.5.16 Release'
description: 'Grand Exchange item stats and multicolor ground markers'
author: Adam

The item stats plugin will now show the stats of gear when selected in a buy
offer on the Grand Exchange.

The ground markers plugin now supports having multiple ground markers of
different colors. The plugin will remember the color that was in use at the time
the marker was placed. Existing markers from prior to the update have no color
and will use whatever the current color is.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fixed XP tracker sometimes not initializing correctly on login, which caused it
  to show very wrong XP rates
- Fix friend notes to work on players with spaces on their names
- Update Chaos Fanatic's slayer task icon to match respawn timer icon
- Fix Ardougne easy diary combat training camp requirement
- Add Hydra slayer helm to examine and bank value prices

Enjoy!
