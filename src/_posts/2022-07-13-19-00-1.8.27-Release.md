### Behavior changes since the previous update

Since the last blog post I've made a couple behavior changes without a proper blog post explaning them, leading to some confusion. Sorry about that.
These changes are:

The boosts plugin gained a new "compact view", which necessitated a new toggle for turning off the existing boosts panel display, which previously was predicated on the infobox on/off toggle. The new "Display panel" option was defaulted to off, assuming most players use the infobox display instead. If you notice the boost panel missing, go into the `Boosts information` plugin and enable `Display panel`.

Inventory tags and the left and shift-click configuration for inventory items have moved to the shift-right click menu on the items, similar to how the custom swap settings on npcs, objects, and worn items work. This makes it easier to change these settings quickly and removes the "configuration" mode where you are otherwise unable to interact with the items, which can be inconvienent. Inventory tags now supports an unlimited number of different tag "groups"/colors instead of just 6.

The party ping-tile key was made configurable due to it conflicting with the various new shift-click swaps. To use it, go to the party plugin settings and configure the hotkey.

### Farming payment tracker

The farming tracker now tracks patch payments for most trees, fruit trees, bushes. It doesn't work currently with payments to farmers who protect multiple patches, notably allotments. It is denoted via a basket of apples:

It is still possible to see if the patch was composted, since that affects yield regardless of payment, by checking the tooltip.

### GPU improvements

Last week, we changed the underlying libraries our GPU plugin uses for interfacing with OpenGL. As part of this work, we were able to reduce the minimum OpenGL version required to run the GPU plugin to OpenGL 3.1. If you have a particularly old system which was unable to run GPU prior, it may begin to work now. The previous GPU plugin was made available on the pluginhub as `GPU (legacy)` for if you are having issues with the new plugin. Though if you are, particularly if legacy GPU works on your system and the new one doesn't, we would be interested in hearing about it on [Discord](https://runelite.net/discord).

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- XP drop recolors for having the correct prayer no longer considers turning prayers on after
  the game tick but before the xp drop as successfully having the prayer on.
- A bug causing the infoboxes group to be unmovable when in the top-left corner has been fixed.
- The spec counter now much more reliably detects which hitsplat is the spec hit when hits from multiple
  sources happen at the same time (thralls/veng)
- CoX private chest has been added to antidrag
- A bug causing the world ping overlay to freeze on MacOS/Linux has been fixed
- A `hop` command has been added to world hop, eg `::hop 351`
- The loot tracker now tracks `Take-all` on seedpacks
- Various references to the dual arena has been changed to the pvp arena
- PvP arena worlds are now skipped over by the world hopper
- Object indicators now has options to highlight object outlines and clickboxes
- The spec counter now resets at Sotetseg's maze phase
- The hiscores have all been shifted back into place due to the addition of the PvP arena
- The party plugin can now overlay health, prayer, energy, special attack energy, and vengenace status on players
- The bracelet of clay tracker now correctly handles soft clay mining

Enjoy!
