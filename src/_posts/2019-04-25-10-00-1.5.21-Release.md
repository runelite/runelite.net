title: '1.5.21 Release'
description: '2010 menu interface style, Ammo plugin, and barrows puzzle solver'
author: Adam

The interface styles plugin now has a "High Detail menu" option which changes
the game menu to look similar to how it did after the release of RSHD:

![menu](/img/blog/1.5.21-Release/menu.png)

An ammo plugin was added which adds your current ammo and count as an infobox:

The barrows plugin now has an option to show the answer to the barrows door
puzzles:

An option was added to the fishing plugin to make the fishing trawler time left
more accurate:

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- HD healthbars now shows more visible green at very low hitpoints
- Add Neitiznot bridges to agility shortcuts
- Fix Yanille wall and grapple shortcut overlays indicating the wrong level
  requirements
- Fix clan counter to not count yourself as a "nearby clan member"
- Various new clues and fixes to clues added last week

Enjoy!
