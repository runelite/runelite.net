## Loottracker changes

The loot tracker now always remembers loot between client sessions, even when
not logged in with a RuneLite account. Additionally, the loot is stored
per-profile now instead of combined for each profile. This means that separate
game profiles, such as main game, leagues, deadman, as well as separate
RuneScape accounts loot are all separately tracked. Loot is now saved to up to 1
year from the most recent drop.

The old saved loot must be imported into the correct profile manually by
clicking the import button in the loot tracker panel if you wish to keep
your old saved loot:

## New runelite.net link from the Old School RuneScape home page

Jagex have added a direct link to [https://runelite.net](https://runelite.net)
from the [Old School RuneScape homepage](https://oldschool.runescape.com/). This
is due, in part, to the phishing sites which primarily show on Google search.

Due to this we recommend finding RuneLite by following the link from the
official [Old School RuneScape homepage](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

We also recommend using an adblocker when browsing the web if you aren't
already, which blocks the phishing ads on Google and other ads, such as uBlock
Origin (available for [Google
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm),
[Microsoft
Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin).
(Disclaimer: we are not affiliated with uBlock Origin and are happy users))

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The <kbd>alt</kbd> key used to configure the ground items plugin is now configurable
- The entity hider now has an option to hide clan members
- Ground items can now deprioritize the left-click `Take` option on hidden items,
  making it no longer possible to accidentally left click `Take` those items
- Screenmarkers now has a toggle to show their names as a label above the marker
- Group storage withdraw swap has been added to the menu entry swapper
- Hallowed sack was added to the loot tracker
- The roof removal plugin now has an option to always hide roofs in POH
- Jewellery has been added to the item identification plugin
- Mod West's [loot beams](https://twitter.com/JagexWest/status/1416800462712496139) models are
  now used by default for loot beams. There is a setting to change it to use the
  previous model.
- Blood essence has been added to the item charges plugin
- The menu entry swapper can now shift-click swap Climb-up and Climb-down on
  stairs and ladders
- The interact highlight plugin now shows which NPC you are selecting when
  hovering over the menu entry

Enjoy!
