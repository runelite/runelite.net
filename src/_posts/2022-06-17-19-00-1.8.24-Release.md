## Jagex rules update

Jagex have published a new [third party client update](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-clients-update?oldschool=1),
and with it a new set of [third party client
guidelines](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-guidelines?oldschool=1).
These new guidelines remove some previous restrictions which allows us to add
some new features. We've added these features in this update.

### Pickpocket swap

`Pickpocket` can now be swapped on all NPCs, even with a `Talk-to` option, by
shift-right clicking them and selecting `Swap Pickpocket`

### Removing dead NPC menus

The menu entry swapper now has a setting to remove menus for dead NPCs. This
prevents clicking on them while they are dieing, as well as casting spells.
The entity hider additionally has an option to remove the NPC completely so it
is no longer rendered.

### Walk here swap

It is now possible to swap Walk here for both left click and shift click on NPC
by shift-right clicking them and selecting the corresponding swap option. There
is also a global shift click walk here setting in the menu swapper
configuration that affects all NPCs.

### Worn item swaps

Menus on worn items can now have both their left click and shift click option
swapped, which can be configured by shift-right clicking the item when wielded.

## Party system improvements

As you may have noticed, we recently updated the special attack counter plugin
to show a "spec drop" overlay on the player when a special attack lands. This
feature works with the reworked party system, which allows the spec drops to
show on your party members.

The party system no longer requires Discord integration to send or join invites,
and instead uses a passphrase system. This is a lot less finicky and works more
reliably when multiple clients are running.

Creating a party now gives you a passphrase, such as `robe-set-raw-purple`,
which you share with your friends. They just need to click `Join party` and
paste the passphrase to join.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The inventory and chatbox are now movable by holding alt. As usual they can
  be reset to their default position via alt-right click. The `alt` key used to
  drag overlays around is also configurable within the `RuneLite` settings.
- Keris partisan defensive style is now correctly hidden by the attack styles
  plugin
- Another bug causing the `!pets` icons to not show up has been fixed, again.
- Minigame reset timer no longer shows if the setting to enable it is off.
- A bug causing entity hider's hide pets option to not work has been fixed.
- `!lvl cox cm` now works correctly
- Ancient brew, mixed potions, and other more obscure things have been added to the item stats plugin
- The stamina timer now works more reliably and also with stamina mixes
- NPC agression timer now has a setting to show for slayer tasks
- The timers plugin now has a timer for Shadow Veil
- Item charges now supports imbued ring of wealth, and braclet of clay
- The mining plugin now shows respawn timers for gold veins
- The bank plugin now has an option to force right click the placeholder toggle button
- The `Left click walk on core` option of the Corporeal Beast plugin has returned once again
- NPC indicators now has an option to highlight true south-west tile and true
  tile

Enjoy!
