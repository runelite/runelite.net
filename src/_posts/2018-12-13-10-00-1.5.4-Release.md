The world switcher plugin now shows the ping to each game world.

The item stats plugin will now show equipment stats when hovering over items.

The timers plugin now shows an additional infobox for when vengence is active
alongside the existing vengence cooldown timer.

The idle notifier now has a notification for when your special attack regenerates
to a configurable percent.

The camera zoom plugin now allows reducing the outer zoom limit, as well as the
usual extending of it, by setting the limit negative.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The hiscore plugin can now show unranked levels, if the player is on the
  hiscores
- Add Xeric's aid and revitalisation potions to itemstats plugin
- Fix slayer plugin tracking Commander Zilyana tasks
- Add Deadman Mode Tournament hiscore support to the hiscore plugin and opponent info hitpoints lookup
- Fix the bounty hunter interface to be movable again
- Add wyvern staircase to agility plugin
- Correct Oak Armchair level requirement in Construction Skill Calc
- Fix grounditems "only show loot" option to work correctly with multi-tile NPCs
- Fix itemstats papaya fruit health restore

The requirements for the GPU plugin have been slighly reduced to OpenGL 4.2 with
the `GL_ARB_compute_shader` and `GL_ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object`
extensions.

Enjoy!
