MacOS users: A native launcher for the Apple M1 is now available! If you have a Mac with an Apple M1
processor we recommend reinstalling RuneLite with the new launcher, which gives better performance.
As always it is available from <https://runelite.net/>

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Dinh's bulwark special attacks are now tracked via the Special Attack Counter plugin
- Inventory tags now appear on items in the gravestone collection interface
- The cannon plugin is more reliable about detecting your cannon placement in situations where your
  animations are interrupted.
- NPC model outlines are no longer a few pixels mis-aligned when rendered on GPU
- Minimap ground marker overlays have had their positioning corrected
- The Clue Scroll plugin now displays solutions for the X Marks the Spot quest steps
- `!kc cg` is now a recognized abbreviation for Corrupted Gauntlet in the Chat Commands plugin
- The Screenshot plugin can now take screenshots of clan member deaths. Additionally, for collection
  log slot screenshots, it will capture the popup if your game settings are set to show one.
- Ducks are now highlighted during bird tasks in the Slayer plugin
- The Skybox plugin no longer thinks that the inside of Prifddinas is in a dungeon
- Cannon spots in the Jormungand prison have been added to the Cannon plugin
- The bonecrusher xp penalty has been added as an available bonus option in the Skill Calculator
  plugin
- The tag tab tab of the Bank Tags plugin now has a working scrollbar
- The Menu Entry Swapper plugin bank option swaps now work correctly in bank deposit boxes
- The Item Charges plugin tracks Ring of forging charges correctly when its effect is combined with
  that of the Varrock platebody

Enjoy!
