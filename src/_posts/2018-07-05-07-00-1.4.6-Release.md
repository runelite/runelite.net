A helper for Varrock Museum Quiz was added as well that highlights correct answer to
questions in Varrock Musuem basement. Thanks to [vikke1234](https://github.com/vikke1234)
who contributed this feature.

The configuration panel was significantly improved thanks to big contribution from
[takuyakanbr](https://github.com/takuyakanbr). Some of the improvements are:

- Each plugin now has a short description when hovered
- Each plugin now has tags that will make plugins easier to search for
- Plugins can now be pinned to the top of the panel (a new star icon was added next to each plugin name
that when clicked will pin the config option to top)
- Search bar in configuration panel will now always stay on top
- Each configuration page for plugins now have back and on/off buttons at the top of panel

Thanks to another awesome contribution from [PandahRS](https://github.com/PandahRS) who spent
a lot of time manually mapping a lot of RuneScape surface to regions, the Discord plugin now has
a lot of new features, including display of **city** you are in, **dungeon** you are currently
exploring, **boss** you are currently fighting and even **minigame** you are currently playing.

Due to privacy reasons, these new location-based features are disabled in any PVP scenario, such
as PVP worlds, High Risk worlds, DMM and Seasonal DMM worlds.
