author: Jordan

A skybox plugin has been added to draw colors beyond the edge of the game's rendered tiles based on
the player's location. Thanks to [@Abextm](https://github.com/Abextm),
[@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni/), and [@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi) for this feature!

The GPU plugin now supports an option to draw fog, fading the edge of the scene by the configured
amount. Thanks to [@logarrhythmic](https://github.com/logarrhythmic) for this contribution.

- Looking up hiscores will now automatically select the correct game mode based on current world
- Split Valuable and Untradeable screenshot options
- Fix artic pine log exp in skill calc
- Change Caviar healing value from 3 to 5
- Add puzzle solver for monkey madness 1 puzzle box
