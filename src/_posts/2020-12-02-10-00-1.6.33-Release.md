title: '1.6.32 & 1.6.33 Release'
description: 'Numerical ground item despawn timers, custom skybox colors, and leagues time tracking profiles'
author: Jordan

[Ground item](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Items) despawn times can now be
displayed numerically in game ticks or in seconds. Thanks to [@Hydrox](https://github.com/Hydrox6)
for this feature.

The [time tracking plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Time-Tracking), [chat commands
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Commands), and [grand exchange
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Grand-Exchange) now understand main game vs league
and deadman mode profiles, and will track crops, kill counts, and offers of these profiles
separately. All existing crops and other values are automatically applied to your main profile, you
will have to visit each farming patch in-game on each profile for it to be correctly synced up.

The [Skybox plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skybox) now allows you to set a custom
color for overworld and underground areas to use instead of the default area-specific colors.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Using the [bank plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank), you can now trigger a
  bank search using the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>
- The [combat level plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Combat-Level) now shows levels
  needed for a new combat level beyond 99.
- The [DPS counter plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/DPS-Counter) has gained new
  options to only count boss damage, and to reset when a boss dies
- An NPC Deposit-Items swap has been added to the [menu entry swapper
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper)
- The plugin hub button has been sticky'd to the bottom of the plugin list. No more scrolling to the
  bottom to find it!
- The [slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) now recognizes Battlefront
  as a task location
- Chambers of Xeric potions now have their doses shown via the [item charges
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Charges)
- The west Al Kharid palace window is no longer highlighted via the [agility
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) as you cannot go through it
- Some objects marked with the [object markers
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Object-Markers) correctly maintain their marker
  when leaving and revisiting the area
- The [chat filter plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Filter) no longer filters
  some messages for players with icons next to their names
- The [timers plugin's](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) tzhaar timer no longer
  keeps counting when disabled mid-run
- The abyssal sire's [stun timer](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) has been fixed
- The [chat notifications plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Notifications) now
  correctly sends notifications for some messages matching a highlighted word ending in a period
- Using a leagues area teleport will no longer trigger a [home or minigame teleport
  timer](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers)

Enjoy!
