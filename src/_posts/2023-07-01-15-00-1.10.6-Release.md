## Forestry

The woodcutting plugin has had support for forestry added. This includes notifications for each type of event, and an overlay aiding it.

### Prayer reordering

As you may have seen a couple weeks ago, Jagex has changed their rules regarding prayer reordering, and so we have added prayer reordering support to the prayer plugin.
A bug causing prayer filtering to be broken when prayer reordering is on has also been fixed

#### Windows ARM launcher

We now have a native Windows ARM launcher. If you have a Windows laptop or tablet with an ARM processor (common in Microsoft Surface Pro) machines, you can download it from the homepage by selecting the `Download for Windows (ARM64)` option. Additionally, the GPU plugin is now supported on ARM, regardless of what launcher you use.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- When pluginhub plugins become incompatible due to an update, they now show as incompatible instead of silently disappearing
- The motherlode mine respawn timers have been fixed, again, and are now definitely correct
- `!pb` now supports hours
- The feed panel has been removed due to Twitter removing their free API access
