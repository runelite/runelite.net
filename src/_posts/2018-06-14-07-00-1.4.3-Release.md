A blast mine plugin was added which keeps track of lit dynamite charges, as well
as which stage the rock is in.

A chat notifications plugin was added which can underscore your name when spoken
in public chat, as well as optionally send you notifications for trade, duel,
and other chat messages.

A Crystal Math Labs plugin was added which, when enabled, automatically updates
your stats on CML whenever you log out.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

 * ctrl+w and backspace can now be used to delete the last word and the entire
   line from the chatbox input, respectively
 * Add public chat friend name color in chat color config
 * The boosts plugin can now notify you when your boost gets low
 * Add Isafdar and Jatizso fishing spots to fishing plugin
 * Remove 'Actions left' and 'Xp per hour' from Xp Globes when Xp Tracker is disabled
 * Add fungicide spray to item stats plugin
 * The ground items plugin can now grey hidden items from the take menu

Enjoy!
