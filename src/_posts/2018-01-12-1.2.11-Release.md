title: '1.2.11 Release'
description: 'New 1.2.11 release of RuneLite is out. Notable new features are an awesome Hunter Plugin and support for more potion timers'
author: Tomas

In this release we made a lot of improvements to client source, performance and
overall stability of the client. But there are few new features that are
definitely worth mentioning.

First, and the biggest one is **Hunter** plugin (thanks to
[@RobinWeymans](https://github.com/RobinWeymans)). Hunter plugin will show you
state of your traps and also time until they will break. That should improve
your overall hunting experience (and makes the terrible skill less terrible).
Here is small preview:

We also added support for some missing potions for the **Timers** plugin, and that
also includes the newest released potion, Super Antifire Potion.

And last feature on the list is support for **native window decorations**. That
means now you have option to let your window manager handle the window
decorations (title bar, window borders). Here is small preview using my window
manager (bspwm) without any window borders:

As I said in the beginning of the post, we made a lot of improvements to the
client source code (mainly decoupling), so if you are bored Java developer
looking for project to contribute to, you are always welcome!

Hopefully you will like the new release, enjoy!
