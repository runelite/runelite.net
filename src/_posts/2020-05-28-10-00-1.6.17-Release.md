The [Login Screen plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Login-Screen) now supports
changing the login screen background. Choose from any of Old School RuneScape's popular event or
update backgrounds or create your own! (you can even use [custom backgrounds which are not
mirrored](/img/blog/1.6.17-Release/configurable-login-screen-mirroring-is-gone.png)) Thanks to
[@Hydrox6](https://github.com/Hydrox6) for adding this feature.

When placing screen markers, you can now click an on-screen widget to automatically select its
boundaries! (you can still click and drag to create a custom size marker) Thanks to
[@melkypie](https://github.com/melkypie) for this submission.

The [Chat Filter plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Filter) can now collapse
duplicate chat messages. Thanks [@CoreyForsyth](https://github.com/CoreyForsyth) for adding this
enhancement.

_**Highlighted below are some features which we released in 1.6.15 and 1.6.16:**_

The [Interface Styles plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Interface-Styles) has gained
a `Menu Alpha` option which lets you make your right-click menu background partially (or if you're
feeling up to a challenge, fully) transparent. Thanks to [@dekvall](https://github.com/dekvall) for
this addition.

We have changed the highlight and notify behavior of the [Ground Items
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Items). The `Highlight > value` option has
been removed. Ground items now use the configured highlight color if they are highlighted, or use
the appropriate tier value color otherwise. Additionally, a `Notify >= Tier` option has been added
to help configure how valuable an item drop must be to trigger a notification. Thanks to
[@Hydrox6](https://github.com/Hydrox6) for his care in building a flexible solution we hope all
users will enjoy.

You can now customize the background color of overlays and infoboxes. Thanks to
[@TheStonedTurtle](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/11619) for this feature addition.

The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) overlay now displays
which enemy you will encounter. Thanks to [@TrevorMartz](https://github.com/TrevorMartz) for this
addition.

  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Stats)
- The [Report Button plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Report-Button) can now show a
  12- or 24-hour clock
- The [Metronome plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Metronome) has gained its own

  notifications when skills drop below that threshold

  group](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) to the top of the list
- The [Loot Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) now tracks
