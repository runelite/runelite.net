description: 'Custom left click swap and ambient sounds mute'
author: Adam

The menu swapper has a new option to configure the left click option on items, which works similar to the existing shift-click configuration.

Login and logout notifications can now be hidden per-friend by clicking the `Hide notifications` option on the friend.

Chat channels can now show the number of online members in the channel.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The music plugin now has an additional option to mute ambient sounds, which affect passive object sounds such as from magic trees and furnaces.
- The grand exchange buy limit and active traded price has been adjusted to fit on the interface
- The mute button clickbox on the login screen is no longer the entire bottom right area of the client
- Character accents are now ignored when applying chat filters to messages
- The loot tracker now tracks Mahogany Homes supply crates
- The world hopper region filter now supports filters with multiple regions
- The screenshot plugin can now screenshot combat achievement task completions
- Tile indicators now has a separate color configuration for tile fill color
- The party plugin now has a button to join the previous party, as well as join party by id
- Timing for the woodcutting respawn timers has been corrected
- Inventory tags are now shown in the Chambers of Xeric storage chest
- Item identification now works in the group ironman shared storage
- The pickpocket stun timer now works correctly with the dodgy necklace protection
- A rocket emoji was added to the emoji plugin (`>==>`)
- The player `Lookup` option now chooses the correct hiscores based on the world type

Enjoy!
