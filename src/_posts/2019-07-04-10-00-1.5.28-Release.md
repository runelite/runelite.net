title: '1.5.28 Release'
description: 'BA gamble count and duels chat commands, beginner hot cold clues, and 2010 cross sprites'
author: Adam
---

The chat commands plugin now includes the `!gc` and `!duels` commands which
shows your BA high gamble count and dual arena wins and losses with streak,
respectively. You must first win or lose a duel for the client to begin tracking
the counts after the update, however the gamble count will work immediately.

The clue plugin now supports beginner hot cold clues (this is the last of the
updates from the clue update from April)

The interface styles plugin now has an option to replace the left click cross
sprites with the ones from RuneScape

The grand exchange plugin now has an option to show the total amount of the
offers in the grand exchange:

The prayer plugin now can draw a "HD" prayer bar which looks more consistent
with the HD health bar option of the interface styles plugin.

The metronome plugin now works even when game sounds are muted. If you had the
metronome plugin on with the game sounds muted prior to the update, you probably
will want to turn it off now.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix the Shield of Arrav, MEP2, and Shadow of the Storm quest start points on the world map
- Add snakeskin gear to the skill calculator
- Add Larran's chest to the loot tracker
- Fix world map Hosidious rare tree icons and Kourend agility obstacle placement
- Add fishing spots south of the farming guild to the fishing plugin
- The Wintertodt plugin now has an option to send a notification before the
  round start
- Fix Father Jean's location for the easy cryptic clue
- Fix the alignment of some of the icons on the 2005 interface style to more
  closely resemble the 2005 gameframe
- The cooking plugin now tracks burning stew
- Add option to the world hopper plugin to hide the Hop-to menu option on
  friends and clan members

Enjoy!
