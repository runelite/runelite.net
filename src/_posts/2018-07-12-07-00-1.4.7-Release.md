title: '1.4.7 Release'
description: 'Kill count command, prayer bars, and Tears of Guthix plugin'
author: Adam
---

A kill count command was added which can share your kill count with other
players who are also using RuneLite. The client must first observe you
getting a kill count message to record the kill count. It can not read
the kill counts off of the boss log in game yet, but maybe that will come soon.

Note that as the kill count data is sent from the client it is trusted and is not
difficult for someone to fake.

The prayer plugin now can show a prayer bar, below your hitpoints bar, showing
how much prayer you have left.

A Tears of Guthix plugin was added which displays time remaining on the blue streams:

The special attack orb now indicates when you have special attack enabled.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Add broad arrows to the fletching skill calculator
- XP drop plugin will now center text of XP if skill icons are hidden
- Fix agility plugin counting laps on the agility pyramid
- The runecraft plugin can now send a notification when rune pouches degrade

Enjoy!
