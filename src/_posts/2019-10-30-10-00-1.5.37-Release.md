title: '1.5.37 Release'
description: 'Sound volume sliders, area sound mute, and new Jagex statement'
author: Adam

The music plugin now changes the volume sliders on the in-game sound interface
to slide:

![sliders](/img/blog/1.5.37-Release/sliders.gif)

The plugin additionally offers a new setting which will mute area sounds caused
from animations of other players (mostly skilling animations like woodcutting).

Jagex has released a new [third party
client](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1)
statement which builds on their previous
[statement](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1).
The vast majority of the statement seems targeted at features of clients other than
RuneLite; most features listed are not and have never been features of RuneLite.
However there are some changes required to RuneLite to make it compliant, so the
following changes have been made:

- Removal of the Cerberus plugin
- Removal of the reorder prayers plugin
- Remove "opponent's opponent" part of the opponent info overlay
- Remove the pickpocket/talk-to swap from the menu entry swapper
- Remove the minimap overlay from the barrows plugin
- Remove the Walk here/Attack swap on the Corporeal beast dark core

I would also like to thank Mod Bonsai for providing us with draft statements and
allowing us to provide feedback directly to Jagex. The collaboration between us
and Jagex over the last few weeks on this has been more than all of the last 2
years combined.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix the random event plugin hiding menu options for your own randoms
- Fix the combat level plugin not showing combat level range in the wilderness
- Fix world map tooltip for Prifddinas farming patch
- Fix the PvP kill/death counter to once again be moveable
- Fix full teleblock timer
- Add pyramid plunder start-minigame and quick-leave to the menu entry swapper
- Add Fremennik Exiles to the world map and add tooltips for the new
  transportation icons
- The fishing overlay colors are now configurable
- Add coordinate clue descriptor for Island of Stone clue
- Add fishing trawler to the loot tracker
- The loot tracker can now use High Alchemy price for item valuation
- Show price check when examining items on the trade interface
- The wiki plugin can now have its "cast" feature used on items in the bank and
  all other interfaces with items other than the inventory
- The [loot tracker](https://runelite.net/account/loot-tracker) on the website now shows total value of loot
