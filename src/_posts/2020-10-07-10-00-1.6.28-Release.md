title: '1.6.28 Release'
description: 'Multiple infobox groups and birdhouse loot tracking'
author: Adam
---

Infoboxes can now be split into multiple groups, and independently positioned
and rotated. Shift right click an infobox and select `Detach` to move an infobox
to its own group, and `Flip` to change the group orientation between vertical
and horizontal. The groups can be dragged as normal overlays via the usual
method of holding alt. To remove a group, and move all infoboxes in it back to
the default group, select the `Delete` option.

The loot tracker now tracks loot from birdhouses

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The cannon plugin now shows the world your cannon was placed on in the
  infobox tooltip.
- Some graphical anomalies related to drawing models which are very close to
  or partially behind the camera with GPU on has been fixed. This has also
  reduced the complexity of the GL pipeline, particularly with the
  `Compute shaders` option off, so you may find this works for you now if you
  have buggy drivers.
- The [OSRS Wiki Crowdsourcing plugin](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Crowdsourcing)
  is now included and enabled by default. This collects anonymous skilling data
  to help improve the [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki).
- The loot tracker now correctly tracks the Grubby chest.
- An option has been added to outline infobox text, which can improve readability.
- The item charges plugin now correctly tracks destroying dodgy necklaces, rings of
  forging, and amulets of chemistry.
- Examining large stacks of items now shows digit group separators.
- The inventory viewer now has a configurable hotkey to toggle the overlay.
- A `Use` swap has been added for grimy herbs.
- The chat filter plugin can now additionally filter game and spam messages.

Enjoy!
