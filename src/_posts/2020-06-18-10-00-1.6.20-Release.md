title: '1.6.20 Release'
description: 'Hallowed Sepulchre loot tracking and chat commands and infobox menu options'
author: Jordan

We've added support for [tracking collected
loot](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) as well as [completion counts and
personal bests](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Commands) in the Hallowed Sepulchre.
Use the `!kc hs` and `!pb hs` chat commands to see this information. You can even get information
for specific floors by adding the floor number, like `!pb hs 5`.

We've added support for adding menu options to infoboxes! Now if you have the "Death Infobox" option
enabled in the [Death Indicator plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Death-Indicator),
you can right-click the infobox (may require <kbd>Shift</kbd> [depending on your RuneLite
settings](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/RuneLite#require-shift-for-overlay-menu)) to
clear it if you do not wish to revisit it.

In advance of Old School RuneScape's clan system feature we have renamed the Clan Chat plugin to the
[Friends Chat plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Friends-Chat) and similarly renamed
all other option names in the same way. This renaming will not affect your settings.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The client now remembers its screen position when moved across multiple monitors
- The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) correctly applies your
  selected sepulchre overlay color to the arrows and swords found there
- The [Timers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers)'s stamina timers learned how
  the timer is affected when using the Ring of endurance
- You may now hide the farming contract infobox in the [Time Tracking
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Time-Tracking)
- The [Drift Net plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Drift-Net) has better detection
  for fish shaols becoming untagged next to inactive nets and can highlight Annette when you run out
  of drift nets in your inventory
- The [Player-owned House plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Player-owned-House) now
  correctly draws a minimap icon over Occult Altars
- The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) has learned the
  location of an added hot-cold clue step found in Darkmeyer
- The [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) can now update your task
  information when speaking to your slayer master via the slayer gem dialog
- Some tooltip spelling mistakes have been corrected in the [World Map
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map)
- Baby dragons are now highlighted by the [Slayer
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) when on a dragon task

Enjoy!
