description: 'Chambers of Xeric scouting overlay improvements and general improvements and bugfixes'

The [Chambers of Xeric plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chambers-of-Xeric) can now
show your clan chat and world in the scouting overlay. In addition, you can enable screenshotting
this overlay for easy sharing. Thanks to [@Alexsuperfly](https://github.com/Alexsuperfly) for adding
this feature!

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Plugins which have number configuration values now display the value's units (such as ms, px,
  etc.)
- You can now set mouse tooltips to display above or below your cursor in the [RuneLite
  settings](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/RuneLite)
- The [Wiki plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Wiki) gained an option to choose the
  left-click option of the wiki button to be "Lookup" or "Search"
- Resetting your [Bank Tags plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank-Tags)
  configuration will now clear any saved bank tags or tag tabs
- The [Idle Notifier plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Idle-Notifier) will now
  notify you when a chatbox dialog interrupts you from some activities, such as a level-up dialog or
  your kitten becoming needy
- The [Wintertodt plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Wintertodt) no longer sends
  further multiple idle notifications when you are already idle
- The Last Man Standing information interface is now correctly movable

Enjoy!
