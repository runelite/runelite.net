# Clans

![Clan member icons](/img/blog/1.7.10-Release/clan-icons.png)

We've added support for clans across various plugins, including:

- Support for clan messages in the chat timestamps, chat history, chat commands, chat filter, emoji,
  chat colors, and chat notifications plugins
- The Minimap plugin can recolor clan member player dots
- You can hop-to clan members' worlds using the World Hopper plugin
- The Player Indicator plugin has highlighting for clan members
- The Twitch plugin now uses `/t` as its chat trigger

Additionally, the friends chat plugin was renamed to `Chat Channels` and allows adding join/leave
messages to clan and guest clan channels, as well as changing your target chat channel by simply
typing `/f`, `/c`, `/g`, and `/p`, as shown below:

# Party Panel

We have added a plugin panel for the Party plugin which shows your active party members and has UI
for adding new members to your party and toggling specific players' health and prayer displaying in
the overlay. Because of the added panel button, _the Party plugin has been disabled by default_ and
must be re-enabled for those wishing to use it. It also simplifies the invite flow (still via Discord)
so it is possible to create a party and send invites immediately, and also allows accepting join requests
via the client in the panel.

# XP Tracker Per-Hour Rate Resetting

You can now manually reset the XP/hr rates of the XP Tracker plugin without resetting the gained XP,
and configure it to automatically reset these rates after a set timeout duration.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The Item Charges plugin now has a separate toggle for Guthix rests
- Chat message recoloring is fixed for players with spaces in their ingame name
- Skill challenge clues requiring a hammer now recognize the Imcando hammer as being accepted

Enjoy!
