title: '1.5.19 Release'
description: 'HD health bars and ground marker minimap display'
author: Jordan

The [Interface Styles plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Interface-Styles) now
supports an option to display HD health bars from 2009-era RuneScape. This option can be enabled
separately from the rest of the interface styles, and a "Default" style option has been added so
players can use the vanilla interface and still use HD health bars. Big thanks to
[@devLotto](https://github.com/devLotto) for implementing this feature.

The [Ground Markers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Markers) now has an
option to draw minimap squares at their locations. Thanks to
[@genetic-soybean](https://github.com/genetic-soybean) for adding this feature.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Binding necklaces are now tracked in the Item Charge plugin
- Binding necklaces can now be displayed as infobox and have their own notification when they break
- The Ground Items plugin now has a configuration to allow highlighting based on Grand Exchange
  value, High Alchemy value, or based on whichever of the two is higher
- The Special Attack Counter plugin no longer has incorrect values when used in a party
- The Clue Scroll plugin now displays a warning when you are missing a spade for hot-cold clues and
  cryptic clues with a dig location
- Free/Member's world filters have been added to the World Hopper plugin
- The Loot Tracker plugin no longer confuses the crystal chest with the brimstone chest
- The Prayer plugin now takes into account the higher prayer restoration of super restores and
  sanfew serums when displaying its dose indicator
- The Idle Notifier now correctly notifies you should you go idle while enchanting amulets
- Cerberus's lair now has a skybox color assigned to it
- Aerial fishing spots close enough to be caught in one tick are now highlighted in green in the
  Fishing plugin
- The Timestamp plugin now allows configuring the timestamp format
- Karuulm volcano monsters now display their HP values in the Opponent Information plugin
- The Daily Task Indicators plugin correctly shows relog messages for fewer daily tasks
- Some missing pies have been added to the Skill Calculator plugin
- The runecrafting experience for crafting blood and soul runes has been slightly increased to
  account for the experience gained from creating dark essence blocks
- The Quest List plugin can now filter quests by any completion state

Enjoy!
