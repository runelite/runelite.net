The [Item Charges plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Charges) now has an option
to display infoboxes for equipped charged items. Thanks to [@Hydrox6](https://github.com/Hydrox6)
for adding this feature!

The [Chat History plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-History) can now cycle
through private message senders. By hitting Tab, you can easily keep chatting with all of your
friends! Thanks to [@TheStonedTurtle](https://github.com/TheStonedTurtle) for writing this feature.

The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) will now highlight shortcuts
orange if you do not meet the agility level requirement to cross them. Thanks to
[@MrGroggle](https://github.com/MrGroggle) for adding this feature.

The Item Prices plugin now has an
option to display profit from casting High Alchemy on an item

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The Object Markers plugin properly
  highlights some objects which could not previously be highlighted, such as mounted glory amulets
  and wall paintings
- Our custom chatbox text input now wraps long lines, such as heavily-tagged items in the
  Bank Tags plugin
- You can now configure the outline color of the current hovered tile in the Tile Indicators
  plugin
- Tooltips for the new Kourend quests and X Marks the Spot quest have been added to the World Map
  plugin. Additionally, the tree tooltips
  for the Yew Trees in Rimmington have been updated since Veos's arrival.
- Challenge Mode raids now have their time tracked in the Chambers of Xeric
  plugin, and can have their kill count
  looked up via the Chat Commands plugin
  using the `!kc` command followed by `cox cm`, `xeric cm`, `chambers cm`, `olm cm`, or `raids cm`.
  Additionally, the Screenshot plugin
  has learned to take screenshots of Challenge Mode raids upon completion.
- The Wiki plugin now adds a skill guide lookup menu option to skills in your stats tab
- Falador teleport has had its magic XP corrected in the [Skill Calculator
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skill-Calculator)

Enjoy!
