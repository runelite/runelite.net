This release adds a farming tracker plugin, which keeps track of what time your
crops were planted and will notify you after a time when it would be fully
grown. Thanks to [@abextm](https://github.com/abextm) and
[@NotFoxtrot](https://github.com/NotFoxtrot) for their work on this over the
last few weeks.

[@WooxSolo](https://github.com/wooxsolo) contributed a demonic gorilla plugin,
which counts the attacks against you so you can tell when it will switch attack
styles. After it switches, the new style is displayed.

A Cerberus plugin has been added, from
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) which shows the ghost order.

Also, a special thanks to Brandon Kase, FatalWaffles, Jordan Atwood, Maiddog,
NotFoxtrot, and Rprrr for continuing to correct and update the clues.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* The cannonball count plugin tracks the count correctly again
* The side toolbar can now be hidden via a button in the menu bar, or ctrl+f11
* There is now a toggle for highlighting agility shortcuts
* A vengeance other timer has been added
* The XP orbs stay on screen while hovered
* Third age tools added to idle notifier
* XP tracker "actions left" no longer rounds down, and doesn't get confused by
  hopping accounts anymore
* Screenshots can now be taken with the "insert" key
* Add ability to disable low HP and prayer notifications
* Add skill progress bar to hiscore panel
* Add stat change indicator to boosts plugin when indicators are selected

Enjoy!
