title: '1.7.11, 1.7.12, and 1.7.13 Releases'
description: 'Theatre of Blood: Hard and Story Mode, Shayzien and A Kingdom Divided, and other improvements'
author: Jordan
---

RuneLite has been updated to support Theatre of Blood: Hard Mode and Story Mode. Players' Hard Mode
kill counts are saved and can be shared using the `!kc` [chat
command](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Commands) or looked up on the [hiscore
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/HiScore).

The various content updates centered around Shayzien and the A Kingdom Divided quest have been
updated in the client, including:

- Many existing clue scrolls in the Shayzien region have had their solutions or directions changed,
  and a number of new clues have been added
- The new Arceuus spells now display timers of their duration and cooldown
- The Shayzien agility course has a lap counter and shows the number of laps needed to reach your
  level or xp goal
- World map icons and tooltips have been added for the A Kingdom Divided quest location and many
  skilling and resource icons in the Shayzien area
- Skill calculator entries have been added for demonic ashes, Shayzien agility courses, and the new
  Arceuus spells

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- You can now look up clan members' hiscore information via the clan member listing
- The team capes plugin has been renamed to the team plugin, and now supports listing of the number
  of nearby players sharing your team cape, friend chat, or clan
- The camera plugin no longer causes your camera pitch to increase when using the compass options
  while "preserve pitch" is enabled. Additionally, an option to preserve yaw while changing worlds
  has been added.
- Menu entry swapper options have been added for achievement diary item teleports and the
  construction cape
- Ground markers, NPC indicators, and object markers now support a configurable width for their
  overlays
- XP drops now support an option to override the standard client xp drop color allowing you to use
  any color, not just the select few client choices, for your xp drops
- POH icons for house objects decorated with the goblin decorations now display correctly
- Ground item despawn timers have been corrected for items appearing while fighting Tempoross
- The new A Kingdom Divided login screen has been added to the Login Screen plugin
- The colors of the inventory grid overlay are now customizable
- The spec counter plugin now displays special attacks landed on the Alchemical Hydra. It also
  resets its counter when leaving instanced areas.
- Wintertodt supply crate loots are now tracked in the Loot Tracker plugin
- An option has been added to capture screenshots when achieving new collection log entries
- Screenshots captured while on tournament/beta worlds are now stored to a separate folder for
  better organization
- Item stats shown for stamina potions while wearing the ring of endurance now correctly show it
  restoring 40 run energy rather than the usual 20
- A bug which could cause clients to launch without correctly downloading Plugin Hub listings has
  been fixed

Enjoy!
