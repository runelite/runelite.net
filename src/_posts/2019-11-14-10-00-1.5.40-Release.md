description: 'Barbarian Assault healthbars, source dependent mutes, and ground item examine'
author: dekvall

The Barbarian Assault plugin now allows the healer to show the health of its teammates:

![ba healthbars](/img/blog/1.5.40-Release/ba_healthbars.png)

The music plugin now additionally allows for configuring which area sounds should be muted based on source.
You can now for example, filter out the sound of everyone else woodcutting while still hearing yours.

The examine plugin now offers functionality to examine ground items so that you can check the value of
your loot before even picking it up.

A new `!layout` command has been added to the Chambers of Xeric plugin to share a scouted raid layout.

Also, we'd like to thank Jagex for updating their [post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1) about 3rd-party clients with the statement that RuneLite is compliant with their rules.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Add "sound" and "volume" tags to music plugin
- Remove paste to password on login screen as jagex added their own
- Add Reset option to various session overlays
- Add option to use last world as default
- Add cannon spot for trolls at Quidamortem
- Add arctic pine logs to the woodcutting plugin
- Fix ScreenshotPlugin Kingdom of Miscellania double screenshot
- Add untradeable item values for long/curved bones, tattered pages and shells
- Add five new emojis; Fire, Heart eyes, Alien, Wave and Eggplant
- Add more detailed location description for Mausoleum emote clue
- Highlight correct crate for Rommik's shop clue
- Fix speccounter for players with 200m hitpoints
- Add Black Demon cannon spot in Chasm of Fire
- Fix Island of Stone coordinate hint
- Correct direction of Miscellania island coordinate clue
- Fix yew tree Sherlock challenge
- Add notify option for impling spawns
- Add black border to wilderness crab teleport icon
- Fix resetting divine potion timers on death
- Make GWD kill count overlay movable
- Use mouse dragged distance to determine if the inventory grid should show
- Add rc-altar icons to worldmap
