title: '1.6.10 Release'
description: 'Damage counter, drift net plugin, and 2006-style interfaces'
author: Adam
---

A DPS counter plugin has been added which displays your DPS, or just total
damage, to NPCs. If you are in a
[party](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Party), it will show a
breakdown of each member's damage.

A drift net fishing plugin was added which shows the status of your nets and
highlights any fish you haven't tagged

The interface styles plugin has an additional new 2006 interface style

The friend notes plugin can now display an icon next to friends who have notes

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix the music plugin sliders sometimes not working
- The spec counter plugin now uses hitsplats to determine spec hit instead of
  xpdrops - fixing it to work more reliably in scaled raids and other situations
  where the hitpoints xp multiplier is not constant
- Extra mouse buttons (4+) are now prevented from clicking in-game
- The raids scout overlay now includes the world's region (US/GB/AU/DE)
- Fix the agility overlay laps remaining to account for agility pyramid bonus xp
- Add Lovakite rocks to the mining respawn timer
- Add Nightmare dungeon and boss areas to Discord game events and skybox
- Add menu swap for essence mine teleport
- Add cannon spot for Lizard Shamans and Black Knights
- Fix the venom hitsplat image in the poison infobox
- Add deposit boxes to shift-click deposit
- Add tooltips to the Prifddinas mining sites on the world map
- The custom cursor plugin now has an option to set your cursor to the weapon
  you have equipped
- The chatfilter can now also filter messages by player name
- Add world map teleport targets to wilderness levers
- Ground items now supports quantity thresholds, eg: `chaos rune>100`
- The object indicators plugin now supports per-indicator colors
- The time tracking plugin's timers are now sorted in ascending order, and have
  a warning color when they are low

Enjoy!
