description: 'New chat box input for Bank Tags and kills to level in XP Tracker'
author: Jordan
---

The [Bank Tags plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank-Tags) now utilizes a new
custom input box which includes a moveable typing cursor, multiple character selection, and mouse
interaction. Additionally, as a result, editing tags will no longer clear any open bank searches.
Huge thanks to [@Abextm](https://github.com/Abextm) for writing the framework of the new chatbox,
and to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) for hooking it in to the bank tag plugin.

The [XP Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) will now display
the remaining number of kills to reach a level in combat skills, rather than the number of actions.
Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for this update.

When running RuneLite with custom chrome disabled, the sidebar switcher image will be a small
Runescape-themed arrow in the upper-right corner of the screen. Thanks to
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) and
[@Abextm](https://github.com/abextm) for this improvement.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [WASD Camera plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/WASD-Camera) will now prepends
  your player name to the chatbox text
- The [Examine plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Examine) will now perform price
  lookups on items examined within the looting bag interface
- The [Menu Entry Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) now
  offers a "Repairs" option swap for the dark mage
- A configuration option has been added to the
  [Opponent Information plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Opponent-Information)
  which allows you to hide the "Opponent's opponent" line which ordinarily appears beneath the
  health bar in multi-combat zones
- Game overlays in the fixed viewport should now be more accurate
- Fix Werewolf agility course xp in the skill calculator
- Add Burgh de Rott shortcut to agility plugin
- Add configuration to opponent info plugin for whether or not to show your opponent's opponent
- Add menu swapper for dark mage "Repairs" option

Enjoy!
