The minimap and xp tracker can now be moved by holding alt:

An achievement diary plugin was added which shows skill requirements on each
task in the diaries:

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:
 * Fix minimap overlays drawing on the minimap when it was hidden
 * Fix minimap plugin to be able to hide the minimap on 'bottom line' side stones
   arrangement
 * Fix !kc not working in private messages
 * Rewrite ge plugin alt+click search to work more reliably on more interfaces,
   such as the inventory when in the grand exchange.
 * Add abyssal sire stun timer
 * Fix opponent info plugin hiscore lookup on seasonal deadman worlds
 * Fix menaphite emote clue requirements
 * Fix XP tracker to no longer track skills while they are not being trained
 * Fix XP tracker to track past virtual level 126, up to 200m
 * Add "show exact value" option to bank value plugin
 * Move banana plantation clue out of tree
 * Fix height of ground items

Enjoy!
