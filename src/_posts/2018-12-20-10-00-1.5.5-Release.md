A chat timestamp plugin was added which adds a timestamp to messages.

A cooking plugin has been added which tracks success and burn rates.

The ground items overlay can now be quickly hidden by double tapping alt. It can
be unhidden by pressing alt again. Thanks to
[@Berry-95](https://github.com/Berry-95) for this contribution.

Gargoyles, desert lizards, mutated zygomites, and rockslugs now have an overlay
shown when they are weak and can be killed with their corresponding item.

The xp drop plugin can now be configured to show fake XP drops at tick intervals,
if there is no xp drop at that time.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix GPU plugin sometimes getting stuck in a canvas rebuild loop after the
  client starts
- Fix level 37 wilderness hot clue step location
- Add Bottle of Wine stats to item stats plugin
- Add silver jewellery to crafting skill calculator
- Add missing empty ammo slot requirements to emote clues
- Prevent overlays rendering if fullscreen map is open

Enjoy!
