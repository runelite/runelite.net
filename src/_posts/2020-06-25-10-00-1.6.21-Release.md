title: '1.6.21 Release'
description: 'Pyramid Plunder plugin, Ground Items text outlines, NPC Indicator highlight style toggles'
author: Jordan

We've added a [Pyramid Plunder plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Pyramid-Plunder)
which can hide the vanilla timer display and substitute it with an accurate timer infobox.
Additionally, it can highlight the spear traps, unopened doors, unopened urns, chests, and
sarcophagi. Thanks to [@Mitchell-Kovacs](https://github.com/Mitchell-Kovacs) for this addition!

The [Ground Items plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Items) plugin can now
draw an outline around ground item text instead of a simple shadow.

You can now toggle multiple overlay styles for the [NPC Indicators
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/NPC-Indicators) to show any combination of NPC
location, southwest tile, and hull. Thanks to [@haakonrp](https://github.com/haakonrp) for this
feature.

With [the update to the game's death
mechanics](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/death-changes?oldschool=1), the Items Kept on Death
and Death Indicator plugins are no longer needed and have been removed from the client.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [XP Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) has an option to
  move skills with most recent XP gains to the top of the list
- The client now remembers when your sidebar is hidden across client restarts
- Your selected [bank tag tab](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank-Tags) is now saved and
  remembered when opening the bank equipment interface
- The [Anti Drag plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Anti-Drag) now prevents dragging
  in your inventory when the bank interface is open
- The [Friends Chat](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Friends-Chat) plugin has an option to
  configure the duration that join and leave messages remain in chat
- A Tan-all swap has been added to the [Menu Entry Swapper
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper)
- Drakan's medallion teleport locations have been added to the [World Map
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map)
- The [Discord plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord) now shows when you are
  in the Hallowed Sepulchre
- A toggle to hide tooltips in the spellbook has been added to the [Mouse Tooltips
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mouse-Tooltips)
- You can toggle the Daeyalt essence experience bonus in the runecrafting [Skill
  Calculator](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skill-Calculator)
- Timers have been added to the [Mining plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mining)
  for Daeyalt essence rocks
- The [Chat Commands plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Commands) can now track
  personal best times for Chambers of Xeric teams of 24+ players and updates its values for personal
  best times from previous PB times

Enjoy!
