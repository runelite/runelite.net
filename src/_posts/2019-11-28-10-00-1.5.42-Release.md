The [Woodcutting plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Woodcutting) now supports showing
respawn timers for chopped trees. Thanks to [Dava96](https://github.com/Dava96) for this
contribution.

The [Entity Hider plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Entity-Hider) has an added
option to hide the pets of other players. Thanks to [Trevor](https://github.com/Trevor159) for this
addition!

We've added support for Twisted Leagues:

- [Screenshots](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screenshot) are named properly for leagues
- [The HiScore plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/HiScore) recognizes the leagues
  leaderboard and displays league points. [Opponent
  lookup](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Opponent-Information) will use this leaderboard,
  and [changing worlds to or from a League world will properly reset your XP
  Tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker).
- [Hot-cold clues found in the Twisted
  League](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) will properly start when read
- The [Death Indicator
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Death-Indicator) has learned the Twisted League
  respawn location and now works in Twisted Leagues.
- Your [HP regen meter](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Regeneration-Meter) will update
  at the appropriate accelerated rate [if you are in the
  #endurancegang](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Endless_Endurance)
- [Chat history](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-History) will display correctly when
  logging in to a Twisted League world
- Teleporting with the Kourend home teleport [will now correctly add a Home Teleport cooldown
  timer](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers)

Finally, a [League Chat Icons plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/League-Chat-Icons)
has been added which can help players distinguish between League players and ironmen in the main
game. Thanks to [hsamoht](https://github.com/hsamoht) for this new plugin.

The [Chambers of Xeric plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chambers-of-Xeric) has had
its rotation whitelist format updated. Now, instead of formatting whitelisted rotations as a list
of bracket-encapsulated rotations (eg. `[muttadiles, shamans, mystics][vespula, tekton, vasa]`),
they should have the brackets removed and be put on a new line per rotation, like the following:

```
muttadiles, shamans, mystics
vespula, tekton, vasa
```

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- [Object markers](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Object-Markers) marking objects which
  can change into other objects can be properly removed
- The [Rune Pouch overlay](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Rune-Pouch) now displays your
  stored runes on both the normal Rune pouch and the Rune pouch (l)
- The [Screenshot plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screenshot) can now take
  automatic screenshots when a player on your friends list or in your clan dies near you to help
  ensure they can re-experience their death
- Teleport sound effects have been classified as "Others' area sounds" for the purpose of muting via [the
  Music plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Music)
- You can now configure the [FPS Control
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/FPS-Control) to limit your FPS to two different
  amounts when the game is focused or unfocused.
- The ![Woman face-palming
emoji](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dekvall/twemoji/runelite-emoji/runelite-emoji/1f926.png)
  facepalm emoji has been added to the [Emojis
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Emojis) as the emoticon `M-)`
- The client now continues to [flash
  notifications](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/RuneLite#flash-notification) until it
  becomes focused (instead of clearing notifications by only mousing over the window)

Enjoy!
