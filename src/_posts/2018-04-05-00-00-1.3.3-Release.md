Bank tags have been added, which allow tagging items in the bank which can later
be searched on. Thanks to [@devdennis](https://github.com/devdennis) for this,
and [@abextm](https://github.com/abextm) for the input dialog work.

You may now also customize the shift click option of any item in the inventory.
Right click the inventory and select "Configure", then select the option on the
item you want to use for shift click. Thanks to
[@Kamielvf](https://github.com/Kamielvf) for this!

The player indicator plugin can now render players clan ranks next to their
names and also show friends, teammates, and clan members in the right click menu.
