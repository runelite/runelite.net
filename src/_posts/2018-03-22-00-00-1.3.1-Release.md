A prayer reordering plugin has been added which lets you reorder the prayers in
your prayer book. Big thanks to [@devdennis](https://github.com/devdennis) for
the excellent work on making this possible;

[@McSwindler](https://github.com/McSwindler) contributed a NPC highlight plugin
which lets you tag npcs, and also configure a list of npcs which are
highlighted.

A bank evaluator has been added, which is a combination of effort from myself,
[@jplsek](https://github.com/jplsek), and
[@TheLonelyDev](https://github.com/TheLonelyDev). It will tell you the overall
GE and HA price of each tab of your bank.

The ground items plugin now supports quickly hiding and highlighting items.
Thanks to [@sethtroll](https://github.com/sethtroll).

A herbiboar plugin has been added from
[@Perterter](https://github.com/tylerthardy). It highlights the starting rocks,
trail, and the two objects to search at the end of each trail.

An item price plugin has been added, from
[@ChaoticConundrum](https://github.com/ChaoticConundrum), which shows the price
of items when hovered over in the bank.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* Ground items now support wildcards in both hidden and highlighted fields, so for example `*bone*`
  will hide/highlight all bones
* The boosted stats plugin now shows time until next change
* The agility plugin allows configuring of the hitbox overlay color
* Game menus options are no longer left broken when moving regions with the menu
  option
* Attack style plugin now hides attack styles better
* Fixed Kourend library plugin, which was broken last release
* Show glory location in POH plugin
* Common cannon placement spots have been added to the cannon plugin
* Remaining XP to level has been added to the hiscore panel
* Removed background from the prayer flick overlay, which made the quick prayers
  toggle hard to see
* Added godwars altar timer
* Superior slayer notifications have been added to the slayer plugin
* The slayer plugin infobox (with your current task) now has a configurable
  timeout
* The time until levelup has been added to the xp tracker panel

Enjoy!
