title: '1.5.15 Release'
description: 'Music unlock notifications, clan chat join messages and member counter'
author: Adam

A music notification plugin was added which sends you a message whenever a new
piece of music is unlocked.

The clan plugin now has an option to show when players join or leave clan chats.
The messages disappear after a short duration, and can also be filtered by
player rank.

The clan plugin also has an option to show an infobox of the number of clan
members near you.

Finally, the clan plugin has a new option to show clan member rank in public and
private messages too.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix Monkey Madness I requirement on the Kourend Diary
- Fix twitter feed links not working in the news panel with newer Twitter theme
- Add pestle and mortar to idle notifier
- Replaced our raids point overlay with the ingame one, and made it movable with
  alt.
- Move Tai Bwo Wannai Emote location closer to STASH unit
- Fix logging into RuneLite accounts after having just logged out
- Add Compost, Bastion and Battlemage potions to Herblore skill calc

Enjoy!
