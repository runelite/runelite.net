Recent Clan chats are now listed in the clan chat tab when not already in a clan chat room. Thanks
to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) for this feature.

An enhancement has been added to the bank tags feature to tag items in your inventory or equipment
directly, also thanks to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni).

Tag tabs can now be imported from and exported to the clipboard. After exporting tag tab from RuneLite,
clipboard contents should look like this (this is mining tag tab with prospectors and d pick):

```
mining,12797,12020,12019,12016,12015,12014,12797,1712,1710
```

and you can view it online [here](https://runelite.net/tag/show/mining,12797,12020,12019,12016,12015,12014,12797,1712,1710).
Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for this feature.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fixed a bug where the OSBuddy price overlay text was duplicated on the Grand Exchange offer screen
- Motherlode Mine and raiding have been added to the Discord plugin activity reporter
- Private messages received from player moderators are now properly recolored
- The Chambers of Xeric scouting overlay now displays while at the nearby bank
- Bank tag icons now display a higher quantity for stackable items
- Bank searching (and thus bank tags) now allows for terms larger than 15 characters
- The wilderness kill/death counter, Bounty Hunter stats widget, and Zeah mess hall widgets are now
  moveable
- Fixed some slayer plugin parsing bugs
- An option has been added to the Bank Tags plugin to remember the last-opened tag tab
- An option has been added to the Runelite settings to display your username in the window title
- Some bugfixes for clues (particularly the newly-added 3-cryptic clues) have been added
- Runelite on OSX will now attempt to use terminal-notifier for better-quality notifications
- The Menu Entry Swapper plugin can now swap Quick-pass/travel/start menu options

Enjoy!
