title: '1.6.37 & 1.6.38 Release'
description: 'Ground marker sharing, refreshed hiscore boss icons, and filled inventory tag display'
author: Jordan
---

We've added the ability to share ground markers. Click the "Export Ground Markers" option on the
world map orb to copy nearby ground markers to your clipboard, or click the "Import Ground Markers"
option to load them into your game! Thanks to [@LlemonDuck](https://github.com/LlemonDuck) for
adding this feature.

The hiscore panel's boss icons have been refreshed and tidied up, courtesy of
[@Psikoi's](https://github.com/Psikoi) excellent updated icons.

A "Fill" display has been added for your inventory tags, which can be toggled alongside the existing
outline and underline options. Thanks to [@1jz](https://github.com/1jz) for this addition.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Support for soul wars has been added across our plugins, such as the rank in the hiscore panel and
  chat commands, tooltips on world map icons, food and potion boost information, and loot tracking
  for spoils of war.
- A toggle has been added to the GPU plugin to render brighter textures so you can enjoy the
  brighter look of your fire and infernal capes
- The plugin hub panel now sorts plugins by user count so you can more quickly find popular plugins
- The Time Tracking plugin can now show the soonest completion of a crop for your farming tracker
  categories (eg. Show time until your first tree grows, instead of when they would all be grown)
- The Special Attack Counter plugin no longer resets your damage when attacking the Corporeal
  beast's Dark core, Vorkath's Zombified spawn, or combat dummies. It also tracks damage from the
  bone dagger, bone crossbow, and barrelchest anchor, and can send special attack energy threshold
  notifications
- World map icons and tooltips have been added for Watson teleport scrolls, Mahogany Homes
  locations, ancient cavern mining rocks, and the Crabclaw caves agility shortcuts and quest
  chamber
- The menu entry swapper now supports swaps for Spria's NPC Contact, the Dwarven rock cake, and the
  Skull sceptre
- You can now configure the color of the Tears of Guthix vein overlays
- Dragon skilling tools with the Trailblazer ornament kits are now correctly recognized by their
  respective skilling plugins
- The Idle Notifier plugin now supports low & high run energy notifications
- The Time Tracking plugin has been taught the correct growth times for sweetcorn and watermelons
- The XP Globes plugin can now show your virtual level in the tooltip

Enjoy!
