# MacOS extended draw distance

On MacOS, the GPU plugin now supports extending the draw distance further. To do so, enable the
`Compute Shaders` option in the `GPU` plugin and then restart the plugin. Big thanks to
[@LlemonDuck](https://github.com/LlemonDuck/) for doing a lot of work on this.

We've also fixed some symbols on the clue scroll and barrows overlay showing incorrectly on MacOS,
as well as the dropdown menu on the plugin search bar.

While we still do not have an MacOS launcher that runs native on the Apple M1, the core client has been
updated so it can run natively if you run the launcher `RuneLite.jar` [directly with a native JVM](<https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/MacOS-Arm64-(M1-chips)-Native-Support>).
If you are technically apt enough to do this, it may be worth it if you have one of these new machines.
We still plan on providing a native launcher for the M1 in the future.

# Farming tracker notifications

The time tracking plugin now has an option to send notifications when crops are done growing.
It can be enabled per-crop by clicking the bell icon.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The tag tab named `clue` now works once again
- The entity hider now allows hiding ignored players
- Chat messages replayed by the chat history plugin on login no longer re-trip commands or notifications.
  They also no longer lose their coloring.
- The fishing plugin can now send notifications for flying fish when fishing minnows
- The idle notifier now works at the Ectofuntus and at looms
- Spoon and weary face emojis have been added (`--o` and `Dx` respectively)
- The loot tracker now tracks the new chests from the Shades of Morton and Isle of Souls
- The chat notifications plugin has a new option to send you notifications for receiving private messages
- The despawn timer in the ground items plugin was fixed for the Nightmare instance, and one has been added for tables
- A `Use` swap was added for battlestaffs
- The chat color username recolor option now works correctly on ironmen and player moderators
- The player name of the client which sends tray notifications is now included in notification title
- The screenshot plugin now has an configurable threshold for which Valuable drops to screenshot. This allows
  setting a very low valuable drop notification in order to see the drops in the chat box, but still
  screenshot certain valuable ones
- The music volume percentage is now shown when hovering the draggable handle, instead of just the track

Enjoy!
