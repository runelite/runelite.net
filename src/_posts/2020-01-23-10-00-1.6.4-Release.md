description: 'Loot tracker history and Clan member recoloring'

The Loot Tracker plugin has been reworked to retain your loot for longer and will load a greater amount of loot data when starting the client, starting with loot received last weekend. This will make it easier to track your progression when going for those very rare drops. This requires being logged into RuneLite.

The Clan Chat plugin now has the ability to recolor players that also are on your ignore list.

The "Request focus on Notification" feature on Windows now will forcibly bring the client into focus, similar to how it works on OSX. You may want to disable it if you had it enabled previously and do not want this behavior.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Add Brimhaven cart traveling to menu entry swapper
- Add Chambers of Xeric personal best tracking to `!pb` chat command
- The opponent info plugin now gets its known max NPC hitpoints from the wiki

Enjoy!
