There are also numerous smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Duplicated display of actively traded price in GE interface has been fixed
- Teleblock timers are now removed when entering safe zone/leaving wilderness
- Search bar was added to the skill calculator plugin
- Little boulder in Weiss was added to the agility plugin obstacle highlighting
- Notes plugin now supports undo and redo (with ctrl-z and ctrl-u)
- Instance map now has a close button in top-right corner
- NPC indicators now has support for highlighting the south-west tile for large NPCs
- Idle notifier now also supports idle notifications for low oxygen on Fossil Island
- Charged versions of the new wilderness weapons will now display their prices correctly
- World map clipping in fixed mode has been fixed
- Multiple world points for hot/cold clues has been centered and should not show the wrong destination anymore
- The opponent info plugin now has a configuration option to always show opponent health in percent
- The Discord plugin now has a configuration option to hide the "time elapsed"
- You can now configure the prayer flick helper to show even when prayers are off
- Fix loot tracker not grouping Barrows loots

In regards to the [world hopper being disabled](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-09-18-Worldhopper-disabled):
After speaking with Jagex and other client developers, we think the chat message hop-to option is what is causing the issues. Jagex is allowing us to readd the world hopper without this feature in this release, and will let us know if it causes any further problems.

Enjoy!
