description: 'Stash unit build status, mobile-style clan tab chat, and music list searching'
author: Jordan

The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) will now display
whether you have built the STASH unit for emote clues and will mark the tile of nearby STASH units
when travelling to complete your clue. Thanks to [@hex-agon](https://github.com/hex-agon) for this
contribution!

The [Clan Chat plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clan-Chat) now offers an option to
allow chat typed in the Clan tab to be sent to your clan chat without the need for your message to
start with `/`, just like on mobile!

A [Music List plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Music-List) has been added, which
adds similar functionality as is found in the
[Quest List plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Quest-List), that is ability to show
only unlocked or locked songs, and search functionality. Thanks to
[@achencoms](https://github.com/achencoms) for adding this feature.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Plugin names in the plugin list panel now display a pop-up menu when clicked, linking directly to
  their wiki pages
- The
  [Special Attack Counter plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Special-Attack-Counter)
  no longer resets recorded special attacks when interacting with NPCs which cannot be attacked
- The [Cooking plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Cooking) properly displays the time
  to fermentation when making a full inventory of wines
- The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) will now display
  solutions for
  [beginner-level map clues](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails/Guide/Maps/Beginner)
- A bug which would cause the special attack bar to not be updated when hide auto retaliate was on has been fixed
- The [World Map plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map) now shows the location
  of the Camulet teleport
- An option has been added to the
  [Menu Entry Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) to swap
  "Send-parcel" and "Quick-pay(100)" for quick and easy access to the hardwood grove in Tai Bwo
  Wannai
- The [Chat Filter plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Filter) now has options to
  prevent filtering messages sent by friends and clan members, and will now never filter messages from yourself
- The [Opponent Information plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Opponent-Information)
  can now display your choice of HP value or percent (or both!) on the displayed opponent HP bar
- The Clue Scroll, Time Tracking, and World Map plugins have had updates to reflect last week's
  Hosidius rework

Enjoy!
