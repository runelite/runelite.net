New raids plugin was added by [@Kamielvf](https://github.com/Kamielvf). This plugin will make raids
even more pleasant experience and adds support for scouting.

Due to recent success of Woox's [Kourend library website](https://wooxsolo.github.io/KourendLibrary/index.html) one
of our contributors [@Abextm](https://github.com/Abextm) decided to top that and implement similar feature
but directly into the client. It shows where requested books will most likely be and also people who can
request books from you.

For everyone who loves smithing, Blast Furnace plugin was added.
Shows money in coffer and bars in dispenser. Thanks to [@sethtroll](https://github.com/sethtroll)!

The configuration system was significantly improved and the plugin manager interface was changed
to provide better access to enabling and disabling of plugins.

New chat history plugin was added, that will preserve your chat history during logout and world
hopping. Never miss messages due to hopping again!

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* Screenshot plugin was improved and should now properly work with most of the level ups
* Tooltips are now displaying even for game interface actions
* `<img=>`for ironmen, player moderators and jagex moderators now instead shows the correct icon
  when hovered
* Toggle to show only highlighted items was added to the Ground Items plugin
* Configuration for the color of the NMZ absorption counter was added to the Nightmare Zone plugin
* Clan chat icons now look good even in fixed mode

Enjoy!
