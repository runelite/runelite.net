The NPC indicators plugin now has an option to show respawn times for tagged
NPCS. Thanks to [@WooxSolo](https://github.com/WooxSolo) for his work on this.

[@DannysPVM](https://github.com/DannysPVM) added a death indicator plugin which
remembers where you've died last, and on what world.

The prayer flicking plugin was renamed to the prayer plugin - and now shows
prayer indicator infoboxes, from [@raqes](https://github.com/raqes).

The full screen mode added in last weeks update was removed as it is not working
for some users and getting their client stuck in a nonworking state. We may add
it back in the future if we can make it work better.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* The screenshot plugin now screenshots pvp kills and pet drops
* A 'Reset others' option was added to the xp tracker panel
* A Charge timer was added
* Fix Callisto and Venenatis boss timers from previous release
* Fix regen plugin showing when orb is hidden
* Added Zeah fishing spots to fishing plugin
* Add dragonfire-charged items to untradeable item mappings
* Fix expeditious bracelet charge tracking, which was broke last release
* Add support for swapping all options on the house portal to the menu entry
  swapper
* Show RuneLite launcher version in the info panel
* Add bake pie and string jewellery to idle notifier
* Fix rare crash when drawing clickboxes

Additionally, there were clue fixes from Jordan Atwood, StanleyMole, and Trig.

Enjoy!
