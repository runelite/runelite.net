### Profile account linking

Earlier this year, [we released profiles to let you easily switch between different plugins and
settings.](/blog/show/2023-02-18-1.9.11-Release) Paired with a new `--profile` client argument for players wanting to
open specific client windows to separate profiles, this helped most players manage their settings neatly, but did not
handle two specific cases very well: players using the Jagex launcher, who could not use a `--profile` argument; and
players who switched accounts in the same client. To help both of these cases, we've added profile account linking,
which lets players associate a RuneScape account with a specific profile, to be automatically switched to when logging
in. (This also supports accounts on special game modes such as Leagues, Deadman, and Quest Speedrunning!)

![A profile with a linked default account](/img/blog/1.10.15-Release/rsprofile-default-linking.png)

Linking an account with one of your profiles is a simple process:

1. Log in to the account to be linked
2. Expand the card of the profile to link it to
3. Click the ðŸ”— button

As seen in the picture above, the link icon will be shown in orange when linked, and you can see
which accounts are linked to it in the button's tooltip.

### GPU performance improvements

Over the last 6 months we have been working in the background on performance improvements, starting with [asynchronous map loading](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2023-05-13-1.10.0-Release) and [extended map loading](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2023-09-09-1.10.12-Release). More recently, we have increased the FPS via improving the tile cull testing, and also converted the client's camera to floating point arithmetic, which makes camera movement noticeably smoother. Unlocked FPS mode is now the default mode in the GPU plugin, we recommend checking it out if you are not using it currently.

### Hide unrelated areas on GPU

Have you ever wondered why you're able to see the Abyss in the distance when scaling the Agility
Pyramid? Or why from one runecrafting altar you're able to see others? Wonder no more, as unrelated
map areas are now hidden when using the GPU plugin.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Object indicators now support a separately-customizable fill color
- The Entity Hider and Random Event plugins both support the new Count Check random event
- Your gains will now be reported via the XP Updater plugin on world hop as well as on logout
- The Report Button plugin's login timer no longer resets on a lost connection being re-established
  without logging out
- The special attack counter now tracks Accursed sceptre specs
- A Mark of Darkness timer has been added to the Timers plugin
- The Skill Calculator plugin learned the xp values for making a Forgotten brew
- 2h axes and campfires have been added to the idle notifier, and the new forestry events added to the woodcutting plugin

Enjoy!
