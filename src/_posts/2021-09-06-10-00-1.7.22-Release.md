title: '1.7.22 Release'
description: 'Interact highlight plugin, improved Slayer and Implings highlighting, and other features and fixes'
author: Jordan
---

We've added the Interact Highlight plugin, which draws an outline around NPCs and objects you hover
over and interact with.

![Demonstration of the Interaction Highlight plugin at the Grand Exchange](/img/blog/1.7.22-Release/interaction-highlight.mp4)

Login and logout messages for friends and friends chat chanels no longer appear for world hops.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The Slayer and Implings plugins now use the same system for highlighting as the NPC Indicators
  plugin, allowing configurable hull/tile/outline overlays to be drawn. Note: this currently
  requires the NPC Indicators plugin to be enabled, we will be removing this dependency in the
  future.
- The NPC Indicators plugin now has a separate fill color option, allowing the fill and border
  colors to be fully customizable
- We've fixed a bug with the Roof Removal plugin which sometimes caused game crashes on teleports
- To match features available in the Steam OldSchool RuneScape client, we have enabled the Antidrag
  plugin in PvP scenarios, and we've increased the walk click distance.
- Loot Tracker entries now display unit price of item stacks in their tooltips
- The new combat achievement slayer helmet variations are now supported in the Slayer and Clue
  Scroll plugins
- The wilderness level vanilla widget has been made moveable
- Swap options have been added to the Menu Entry Swapper plugin for the Desert amulet 4
- The burner timers of the POH plugin have been fixed to be more accurate
- The expanded side panel is now remembered and restored when restoring the sidebar
- UI tooltips on MacOS are no longer cut off by the game screen
- The Roof Removal plugin has had many areas touched up to better hide roofs, and now works in
  instances such as quest instances
- The Grotesque Guardians instance timer has been changed to 5 minutes
- The Loot Tracker plugin now detects loot from Camdozaal vault lootboxes and the rogues' chest
- The Woodcutting plugin no longer shows respawn timers for POH construction trees
- The mining plugin now shows respawn timers for Barronite ore and deposits
- The XP Globes overlay no longer tries to draw itself slightly overlapping its bounding box

Enjoy!
