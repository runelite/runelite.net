title: '1.4.18 Release'
description: 'Wintertodt plugin and virtual levels plugin'
author: Adam

A Wintertodt plugin was added which shows your current activity and can be
configured to notify you when you become idle. It also tracks points in your
inventory from logs or kindling and displays it. Thanks to work from
[@jbfleischman](https://github.com/jbfleischman) for initially getting this
started.

A virtual levels plugin was added which shows virtual levels and virtual skill
total on the skills tab. It is off by default. Thanks to [@Joshua
Filby](https://github.com/Joshua-F) and
[@Nightfirecat](https://github.com/Nightfirecat) for their work on this.

There are also numerous smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Add Fairy Ring AIQ to Mudskipper Point Clue
- Colorize "Lookup" player menu entry if applicable
- Fix Dwarf Cannon quest start location on the world map
- Add notification for low fishing trawler activity
- Add sand to Daily Notifications plugin
- Add daily runes to Daily Notifications plugin

Regarding the [world hopper being
disabled](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-09-18-Worldhopper-disabled), we
have fairly thoroughly reviewed other hopping implementations and can not find
anything with the World Hopper action forcing that would differentiable on
Jagex's side. Based on the
[plugin history](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/commits/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/worldhopper/WorldHopperPlugin.java)
the newest addition is the Hop-To chat option from pull
[#5125](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/5125) which went into RuneLite
release 1.4.15 on Aug 30. Because other clients do not have this feature, this
is my first guess as to what the problem is.

I have asked Jagex to review if there were any issues with the world hopper
prior to Aug 30. If not, we should be able to remove the chatbox Hop-to feature and
reenable the plugin.

Enjoy!
