title: '1.5.36 Release'
description: 'Website redesign and random event plugin'
author: Adam
---

The website has been given an all new dark look, with a redesigned home page.
Thanks to [@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi) and [@gc](https://github.com/gc)
for their work on this.

A random event plugin has been added which can notify you when a random event
spawns for you, and will also hide Talk-to and Dismiss from random events which
aren't yours.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The clickbox generation code has been optimized and now causes less lag when
  drawing complex clickboxes, such as the the herbiboar trail objects
- The object indicators plugin now supports marking many more object types that
  previously did not work, such as the MLM sack and ladders
- Setting the slayer plugin infobox timeout to 0 now makes it never timeout,
  consistent with other plugins
- The item identification plugin now also identifies placeholders and noted
  versions of items
- The inventory grid plugin now shows the results of swapping items, if applicable
- Add Broodoo shield, drift net, spears, and hastae to skill calculator
- Add missing fishing spots from the fishing platform to the fishing plugin
- Fix Monk's residence and Rommik cryptic crate locations
- Add Rimmington ship transpotation icons and locations to the world map
- Fix location of the northern pipe in Mount Karuulm on the world map
