title: '1.2.19 Release'
description: 'Stretched fixed mode, default world, and grand exchange price search!'
author: Adam
---

Stretched fixed mode has been added, which stretches the game screen and makes
it more playable on high resolution monitors. Thanks to [@devLotto](https://github.com/devLotto) for making this happen.

[@sethtroll](https://github.com/sethtroll) added a GE search feature to the
existing grand exchange plugin. You may also use alt+click on your inventory to
GE search an item now.

A news feed plugin was added which shows the latest RuneLite blog posts, Old
School RuneScape news, and a Twitter feed of JMods.

Finally, the long-requested default world plugin has been added thanks to
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam), which sets a preconfigured home
world by default.

There were many smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* The raids plugin now allows configuring whitelist/blacklist layouts and
rotations.
* The screenshot plugin now takes screenshots of raid rewards
* Fix length of prayer enhance timer
* The instance map can now be closed with escape
* The "You are fishing" overlay now works again since the last OSRS update
* [@arlyon](https://github.com/arlyon) improved native OSX support - with native fullscreen, and focus
  requesting
* Fix cannon plugin showing incorrect double hit spots after region change
* Allow disabling of the skill icons on XP drops
* Clear saved private chat history upon clear request
* Fix clanchat icons not showing during region loading
* Add configuation option to make the client size fixed
* Add minimum threshold to teamcape configuration, and now disable by default


Enjoy!
