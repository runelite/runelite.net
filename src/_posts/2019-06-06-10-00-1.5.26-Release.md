description: 'Mining rock respawn timer, inventory grid, and F-key remapping'
author: Adam
---

A mining plugin has been added which shows respawn times for rocks.

An inventory grid plugin was added which will overlay a grid of each item slot
in the inventory when an item is dragged, aiding with rearranging inventory
items.

The WASD plugin has been _renamed_ to the Key Remapping plugin. If you had it on
prior to the update you will need to turn it on again. It now also supports
remapping the number keys (`0-9`, `-`, and `=`) to the F keys, to aid Mac users.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The wine ferment timer was fixed, again, and actually works now
- The Barbarian Assault plugin was updated for last week's game update and now
  correctly shows the wave time again
- Fix the agility plugin not highlighting the Al-Kharid zipline
- Fix the clue plugin to identify the correct stash unit near the Exam Centre
- The authenticator code can now be pasted into the login screen, similar to
  username and password

Enjoy!
