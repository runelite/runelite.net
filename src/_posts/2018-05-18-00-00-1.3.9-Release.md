title: '1.3.9 Release'
description: 'Hot/cold world map improvements, skill calculator, and anti-drag plugin'
author: Adam

I have been given the go ahead to continue on with RuneLite development by MMK,
so here is release 1.3.9.

I have had to move most of my tools to be internal to
the project, and it is taking some time. We will probably be able to begin
accepting PRs again in full force sometime this weekend.

Hot/cold clue locations are now shown on the world map, and fairy ring teleport
icons now have a tooltip showing the fairy ring code. Contributed by
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) and
[@MESLewis](https://github.com/MESLewis) respectively.

[@Kruithne](https://github.com/Kruithne) has added a skill calculator plugin.

An anti-drag plugin has been added from
[@devdennis](https://github.com/devdennis). It lets you configure the "drag
delay" which can help prevent you from dragging items you meant to click on.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The opponent info plugin now displays approximate players hitpoints instead of
  a percentage
- Show GE and high alch prices on shop items when examined
- Made existing config option for higlighting marks of grace also affect overlay
  color
- Add trap obstacles to agility plugin
- Fix motherlode mine plugin when it is enabled when inside of the mine
- Mitigate a rare crash in the official client at certain areas ingame
- Add a tooltip font type configuration option
- Auto complete hiscore lookups based on friends, clan members, and players

Also thanks to trimbe, Shuhao Wu, Jordan Atwood, and Alex Kolpa for contributing
clue fixes.

Enjoy!
