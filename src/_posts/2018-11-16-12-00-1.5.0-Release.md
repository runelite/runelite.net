The RuneLite GPU renderer is live! When enabled, the GPU plugin gives improved
framerate, particularly on larger screens, and increases the distance you can
see in game. Check out this [tweet](https://twitter.com/RuneLiteClient/status/1062440996401790977) for some neat pictures.

The GPU plugin requires Windows (7, 8, or 10), a GPU with support for OpenGL
4.3 or newer, and 2GB of VRAM. This requires either an Nvidia GeForce 400 or newer,
an AMD Radeon HD 5000 Series or newer, or Intel HD Graphics with an Intel Haswell
processor or newer. Also ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date.

We have tested this plugin a lot over the last few weeks, on as much hardware as
we can find, but there are possibly configurations it does not work correctly
on. In particular, we recommend you do not enable it in dangerous situations
ingame (HCIM!) until you sufficiently test that is it stable on your system.

If you find an issue with it open a bug report on our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues) if a bug report for it
isn't already in the [list of known issues](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3Agpu).
Note that currently the GPU plugin does not work with the stretched mode plugin.

Enjoy!
