description: 'NPC unaggro timer and chat filter'

A NPC Aggression Timer plugin was added, which shows how long until NPCs near
you will become unagressive, and how far away you have to walk before they will
become aggressive once again.

The combat level plugin can now show the level range of attackable players near
the wilderness skull icon, similar to how it is on PVP worlds.

Most coordinate clues now show a description of where they are in addition to
showing on the world map.

A chat filter plugin was added, which lets you define words and
[patterns](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
to filter or block from chat messages. With a handful of patterns it is
easy to filter out a majority of the bot spam at the GE.

For example the patterns:

```
5[0-9]x[0-9]
^Player
[0-9.]\s*usd
[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]
doubling
tripling
I don't scam
Fire cape & accounts
```

is highly effecive against the current spam.

We may open up a channel on Discord for users to share patterns similar to bank
tabs.

Even though this is a rather crude solution to the spam epidemic in RS, and
spamfilters are in general a solved problem, any solution which is much more
technically involved would require us to:

1. continuously update training data for the spam categorization
   models (the bad guys can see this, too)
2. centrally process game chat in real time, which is not only hard, and
   expensive, but also would have some privacy issues

Additionally, it would allow the project to unilaterally decide what is and is not spam,
which I would rather it not be capable of doing.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix Twitch plugin sometimes showing duplicate chat
- Bank tag tabs no longer reset when clicking withdraw-x
- Add a menu swap for Contract on guildmaster Jane
- Fix the GE item stats interface not closing correctly if the GE is closed with
  escape key
- Fix the slayer plugin not recognizing Crazy Archaeologist tasks
- Fix many missing or wrong diary requirements in the achievement diary plugin

Enjoy!
