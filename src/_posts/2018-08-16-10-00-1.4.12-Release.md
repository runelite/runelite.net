description: 'World hopper and WASD camera plugins'
author: Adam

A world hopper plugin has been added to ease hopping. You can use the key
combination ctrl+shift+left/right, or right click a friend or clanmates name in
game and click Hop-to. There is also a plugin panel with the worlds listed which
can be double clicked.

A WASD camera plugin was added which lets you use the WASD keys (or, any other
keys) instead of the arrow keys to control the camera. It is off by default and
needs to be enabled in the configuration panel. You must press Enter to chat
when the plugin is enabled.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

 * Fix puzzle box solver showing solution arrows
 * Fix player indicators plugin coloring entire menu option of other players
 * Add Wintertodt to Discord plugin activity
 * Add Woodcutting guild to Discord plugin activity
 * Fix SDMM normal spellbook freeze timers
 * Fix ancient freeze timers resetting on each animation
 * Fix Grotesque Guardian loot tracker
 * Fix seaweed patch times in the timer plugin
 * Fix Chambers of Xeric plugin to not add multiple timers

Enjoy!
