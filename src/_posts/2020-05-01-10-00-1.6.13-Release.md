title: '1.6.12 & 1.6.13 Releases'
description: 'Deadman and poll 70 improvements'

The 1.6.12 release that went out last week was forced due to the game update,
but we did not have a blog post ready. This post covers both releases.

The Leagues hiscore lookup has been replaced now with the newly opened Deadman
tournament, and the various lookup commands in game now recognize the Deadman
tournament worlds and will look up the correct hiscores for them.

Divine Bastion and Battlemage potions have had timers added, and have been added
to the items stats and item identification plugins.

If you use Windows or Linux and the GPU plugin does not work correctly for you,
there is a new option in the GPU plugin you can disable called `Compute Shaders`
which may help. This drops the minimum required OpenGL version to 4.0, and uses
less GPU memory and compute, at the cost of being unable to extend the draw
distance. Despite this limitation it still gives a noticible performance
improvement and may be beneifical to users on older systems. Note that the
option must be toggled off _prior_ to the plugin starting to take effect.

Users using Mac OSX will be happy to know that progress has been made on an OSX
GPU rasterizer that works as described above, due to the limited support of
OpenGL on OSX, and that I expect to have it added to a release in the coming
weeks.

The XP updater plugin can now send xp update requests to
[Wise Old Man](https://wiseoldman.net/), a new xp tracker created by
[@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi/) - who you may remember from the
[obsidian theme](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-05-24-1.4.0-Release), and
has been a contributor to this project for years. It is [open
source](https://github.com/psikoi/wise-old-man), which of course I value
greatly, and recommend you check it out. Since CML has began running RWT ads,
which I dislike directing traffic to, I have been looking at alternatives;
another tracker we added a few months ago is [TempleOSRS](https://templeosrs.com/)
which has been gaining populartity, although not open source. Remember, sending xp
update requests to _any_ external services necessarily sends your IP address and your
display name to that service.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The time tracking plugin timers now have an option to automatically loop
- The idle notifier now works when enchanting bolts
- Laps per hour has been added to the agility session overlay
- Item stats now show on the in-bank equipment interface
- Fix the chat notifier `Highlight own name` setting to correctly work with
  players who have spaces in their names
- The world hopper quickhop feature now has an option to only hop to worlds in a
  specific region
- The bank plugin now has an option to allow entering your bank pin with the keyboard

Enjoy!
