The new Obsidian theme has been released, which re-skins the client UI and most
of the plugin panel intefaces. Thanks to [@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi)
who has been working on this for the last month.

An interface style plugin was added to allow switching the 2005 or 2010 game
frames.

Support for level goals has been added, that loads the XP/level goals from the
Vanilla goals interface and displays it in XP tracker.

The world map plugin now shows all teleport locations, and detailed requirements
for all agility obstacles.
