description: 'GPU anti-aliasing and loot-exclusive ground item display'

The GPU plugin now supports anti-aliasing, which reduces jagged lines. It can
be configured in the GPU plugin settings. Thanks to [@devLotto](https://github.com/devLotto) for
implementing this feature!

The [Ground Items plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Items) now has an option
to only show loot. Thanks to [@Adam-](https://github.com/Adam-) for this feature.

After discussions among the RuneLite team, the fight cave plugin was removed as it was decided to
be too over-powered. For more insight on this decision, [you can read Adam's comment on
this](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/6724#issuecomment-444289767).

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The GPU plugin no longer causes overlays to render in black within the smoke devil dungeon
  and during the fight with the Grotesque Guardians
- The [WASD Camera plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/WASD-Camera) will no longer
  cause camera spinning when the chatbox loses focus
- Marks of grace, golden nuggets, and items bought with them now have prices calculated for them in
  the [Bank Value plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank-Value), the [Examine
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Examine) and others
- The "Panic in the heart of the Haunted Woods" clue step properly warns you to remove your ammo
  slot item
- Teleport icons for the pharaoh's sceptre have been added to the [World Map
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map)
- The fairy ring search chatbox will no longer remain active when you select a teleport destination
  very quickly
- The [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) will now display your
  initial task amount when hovering the slayer infobox
- The Kourend favour widget is now moveable
- The [Screenshot plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screenshot) can now take
  screenshots when receiving valuable and/or untradeable drops

Enjoy!
