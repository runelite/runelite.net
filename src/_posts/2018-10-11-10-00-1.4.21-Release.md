## Bank tag tabs

Thanks to the tireless work of [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni), and supporting work from
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) and [@Abextm](https://github.com/Abextm), we are proud
to offer a new bank tag experience in bank tag tabs!

![Bank tag tabs: adding and selecting tabs](/img/blog/1.4.21-Release/bank-tag-tabs-intro.gif)

As indicated above, tabs can be created for any number of tags by clicking the "+" button in the
upper-left-hand corner of the bank interface, and selecting these tabs will display items tagged
with that tab's tag. More information regarding its features and functionalities can be found [by
browsing the Bank Tags wiki
page](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank-Tags#using-tag-tabs).

## Master clue 3-step cryptic solutions

The Clue Scroll plugin now displays solutions for master-level three step cryptic clues, removing
steps from the overlay as they are completed. Thanks to
[@Eadgars-ruse](https://github.com/eadgars-ruse) for submitting
[(and demonstrating in video form)](https://streamable.com/ujaar) this feature!

## Grand Exchange partial name searching

The Grand Exchange search panel and ingame `!price` command now allow for partial name searching,
yielding better results than before. Thanks to [@Adam-](https://github.com/Adam-) for implementing
this enhancement.

## Visual improvements

Thanks to [@Adam-](https://github.com/Adam-), [@Monsterxsync](https://github.com/Monsterxsync),
[@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi), and
[@SebastiaanVanspauwen](https://github.com/SebastiaanVanspauwen) respectively, a number of plugins
have had their visuals updated, which can be seen below:

- The "To:" and "From:" in split private chat can now be recolored
- A toggle has been added to use default skill coloring for XP globe progress arcs
- XP globes' progress bar has been changed into an overlay directly on the globe to save space
- A chatbox background image has been added to the 2005 interface style

- Regen meters should now be more accurate for the beginning and end of a regen cycle
- Overlays snapped above chatbox will now be rendered when text input or chat dialogs are open
- An option has been added to the boosts overlay to display in yellow when below the boost threshold
- Notifications have been added for highlighted ground items
- The Fairy ring plugin now remembers scroll position when re-opening the fairy ring menu
- The Slayer plugin will now update when assigned a task through partner slayer
- The NPC HP overlay has been updated to use a more accurate HP formula
- The Loot tracker no longer tries to add empty slots from Chambers of Xeric or Theatre of Blood
- The newly-added Al Kharid palace shortcuts have been added to the agility obstacle highlighter
- An idle alert should no longer trigger after casting most Lunar spells
- A toggle to send a notification upon the Ulitmate Force powerup spawning in Nightmare Zone has
  been added

Enjoy!
