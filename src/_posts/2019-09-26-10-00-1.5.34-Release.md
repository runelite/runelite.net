description: 'Bank value searching and volume overrides'
author: Jordan

The [Bank plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank) now supports searching for items
by value. Thanks to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) for this feature.

The [Music plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Music) now offers volume overrides for
the ingame music, sound effect, and area sound effect volumes. These settings allow you to set more
granular values for each of these volumes.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [Opponent Information plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Opponent-Information)
  now has an option to highlight the Attack option for NPCs you are attacking or are attacking you
- Forthos Dungeon monsters now show proper HP values in the [Opponent Information
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Opponent-Information) and will now cause the
  [XP Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) to display kills to
  goal targets instead of actions
- The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) now has an option to
  display laps needed to reach your set agility goal
- You can now set the left-click menu option of the house advertisement board using the [Menu Entry
  Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper)
- The [Timers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) no longer thinks the
  "Protect from Magic" prayer halves the duration of normal spellbook freeze spells
- The [Loot Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) now truncates
  monster names instead of kill count for entries with long text

Enjoy!
