The loot tracker will now track loot received from pickpockets.

~~The old show opponent's opponent option has been readded for NPC opponents;
closer inspection of the [prohibited feature
list](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1)
revealed the original cause for us removing it only applied to PVP: `Indicates whom your opponent's opponent is in PVP`~~

The Crystal Math Labs plugin has been replaced with an `XP Updater` plugin,
which additionally now supports the TempleOSRS tracker. Remember that sending xp
update requests to external services necessarily sends your IP address _and_
display name to that service.

The CoX scouter plugin now has an option for screenshotting the overlay into the
clipboard, making it easy to share.

The clue plugin now tells you when you are missing a light source required for
your clue.

The interface styles plugin now has an option to always used the stacked-stones
arrangement, regardless of client resolution.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The loottracker now can track drops from the Nightmare
- Fix the Wintertodt plugin erronously sending a notification about being idle
  when you are already idle
- Dragging with the inventory grid enabled no longer drags grid cells
- The mouse tooltip position can now be configured to be above the mouse
- Fix imp spawn notifications sometimies not working in Puro-Puro
- The wiki plugin now has an option to make `Search` the default left click
  option
- The shift anti-drag plugin now also works in the bank
- Various hot-cold clues that were slightly off center have been centered, and
  the solver can now sometimes eliminate possible solutions even when the orb
  temperature has not changed
- The imbued heart timer now more reliably works when in combat
- The grand exchange plugin will now also record partially bought or sold
  offers, which can be viewed on the
  [website](https://runelite.net/account/grand-exchange). Additionally, the
  retention history has been upped to 90 days from 30.
- The NPC unaggro plugin can now notify you when the aggression timer expires
- Fix the LMS overlay to be movable
- The custom cusor plugin now allows user-supplied cursors by placing a file
  named `cursor.png` in your `.runelite` directory
- The dragonfire shield cooldown timer has been updated to use the [correct
  time](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1161987121709821953)
- Skilling potions have been added to the item identification plugin
- The twisted league slayer helm is now a recognized slayer item

Enjoy!
