title: '1.5.1 Release'
description: 'Linux support for GPU plugin, CTRL-V paste on login screen, combat tooltips'
author: Adam

Thanks to hard work of [@whitehooder](https://github.com/whitehooder) the GPU plugin now supports also
Linux machines. The requirements are still the same, mesa with at least GL 4.3+ support is required.
Here is small table of [Mesa 17.2.0 GL support](https://people.freedesktop.org/~imirkin/glxinfo/#diff&v=Mesa%2017.2.0).
We are aware that on some graphic cards mesa can support only GL 4.2 even though all requires features
that we use are supported, and we plan to look into that in future.

Thanks to [@bmiddle](https://github.com/bmiddle) Combat Level plugin now displays tooltip for levels
required to next combat level in equipment interface.

Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) you can now paste your username and password to
login screen with CTRL-V. This option needs to be explicitely enabled in Login Screen plugin.

GPU fixes for this week:

- Add support for the stretched mode
- Fix tiles having black outlines on Intel HD Graphics with drivers newer than 20.19
- Fix relying on some undefined behavior causing some AMD cards to not work corectly
- Fix visible lag from resizing the client or when expanding/contracting the side panel
- Fix resource leaks from shutting down the GPU plugin
- More consistently limit interaction with far away objects

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix smoke rune level requirement in skill calc
- Show ironman icons when chat is locked with the WASD plugin
- Add new POH teleport icons to minimap
- Fix hiding attack styles after autocast selection
- Make Skotizo interface layoutable
- Fix some boulders at Maniacal Monkeys not working with the hunter plugin
- Add kills left to XP orbs

Enjoy!
