title: '1.5.9 Release'
description: '!task command and plugin overlay menu options'
author: Jordan
---

The [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) now offers a `!task` command,
which displays your current task, starting amount and, if applicable, task location.

Plugin overlays now support adding right-click menus. Currently, you will only see a "Configure"
option, but expect to see more relevant and useful options in the future.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Users will now be prompted to confirm plugin configuration resets
- The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) correctly shows
  the second emote required for the Mount Karuulm emote clue
- The [WASD Camera plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/WASD-Camera) operates correctly
  when holding modifier keys
- The [Idle Notifier plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Idle-Notifier) now sends
  notifications after making magic tablets
- The Attack skill color has been changed slightly to be easier to see against the
  [XP Globes](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Globes) background
- The [Prayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Prayer) now recognizes prayer
  bonuses of the ancient staff, devout boots, and bonecrusher necklace
- New items will now populate more quickly to be found using the
  [Grand Exchange plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Grand-Exchange) search
- The [World Hopper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Hopper) hop chat message
  can now be disabled
- Anti-venom potions now display the proper time in the
  [Timers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers)

An issue with the world hopper and prayer order plugins post-update has been
fixed. We would like to remind users that we receive _no_ special insight into
upcoming updates and so we do not know what will change ahead of time. After an
update, all or none of the client may be broken in unpredictable ways. Please
don't report issues to Jagex without checking it out on the vanilla client
first.

Enjoy!
