The xp tracker plugin can now add the xp tracker panels to the game canvas,
allowing you move them around like any other overlay:

An emoji plugin was added, which when enabled, replaces common and not-so-common
emoticons such as `:)` with emoji images in game chat. You can find a complete
list of supported emoji and their triggers
[on our wiki](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Emojis)

A smelting plugin was added, which works similar to the woodcutting plugin, and
keeps track of how many bars and cannonballs you have smelted as well as whether
or not you are currently smelting.

The barrows plugin now has a prayer drain timer which tracks how long until the
next barrows prayer drain.

The blast furnace plugin now has a foreman fee timer for those under 60
smithing.

Finally, the cooking plugin now has a wine ferment timer

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix north Arceuus Dense essence mine shortcut
- Add option to notify before next hp regen to the regenmeter plugin
- Add plank make to the idle notifier
- Fix item overlays not appearing on the inventory with the seed vault open
- Add missing CoX fish, and fix Leckish fish healing value in item stats plugin
- Fix npcindicators highlight npc option from the previous release

Enjoy!
