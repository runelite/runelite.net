title: '1.3.4 Release'
description: 'Smooth animations, easier HiScore lookups, and smarter Abyss runs'
author: Jack

Animation smoothing is here to showcase the bleeding edge of oldschool visuals.
Players, NPCs, and environmental objects can now be interpolated (or 'tweened')
to animate at higher framerates. Thanks to
[@DevDennis](https://github.com/DevDennis) for bringing this eye candy to life.

HiScore lookups can now be accessed from many more right-click menus, including
in the chatbox, your friends list, from private messages, in the clan chat
sidebar, and on the raiding party menu (for members with at least a kick-rank).
[@Kamielvf](https://github.com/Kamielvf) worked on this quality of life change,
big thanks to him.

The Dark Mage in the Abyss can now be highlighted whenever your inventory
contains a degraded pouch in need of repairs. Props to
[@jaeger25](https://github.com/jaeger25) for looking after our forgetful
runecrafters.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* Added healing values for 30+ missing foods; most importantly, easter eggs!
* Menu entry swapper: updated the Travel option to include balloons and
Fremennik boats, and added a new Chase option for cats who love rat-hunting.
Pickpocket swapping is now limited to H.A.M. members only, due to unintended
thieving balance issues (eg. with blackjacking).
* Removed the Pyramid Plunder plugin because
[we don't need it any more](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/quality-of-life-improvements?oldschool=1).
Good Jagex.
* Renamed the Attack Indicators plugin to Attack Styles, and added better
control over when the indicator appears.
* Added a toggle for displaying skilling session stats.
* Updated our overlay text to use the current oldschool font, complete with
slashed 0's.
* Fixed several clue scroll helpers which pointed to wrong spots, suggested
the wrong dance emote, or contained typos.
* Hunter plugin: fix bug related to setting traps and walking in the same tick.
* Fixed report button not returning to normal when the plugin was disabled.
* Fixed the bank tag search forgetting to match item placeholders.
* Fixed the screenshot plugin crashing on certain dialogs, like grabbing a
hammer from a Motherlode crate.


Enjoy!
