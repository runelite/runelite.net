title: '1.6.36 Release'
description: 'Improved farming timer estimations and Zalcano damage counter'
author: Adam
---

The time tracking plugin now keeps track of when each account's farming tick
happens and can use it to give much more precise estimations of when crops are
done growing.

The Zalcano plugin now includes a damage counter to track how much damage you
have done to the health and shield, to let you easily track if you've done
enough damage to be eligible for drops, uniques, or the pet.

Many of the existing color configuration options for overlays now support
adjusting their transparency too.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Texture brightness with the GPU plugin has been adjusted to more closely
  reflect the software rasterizer
- FPS with GPU on in areas with full-screen transparent overlays, such as
  Godwars, under water, and Ver Sinhaza has been improved
- The xp tracker now respects the in-game xp tracker position setting
- Fix some dead clicks when trying to alt+drag or alt+reset overlays
- Fix item overlays, such as the rune pouch or item identification overlays,
  from drawing over top the world map
- The barrows reward potential overlay colors are now exact and no longer an estimation
- Fix the Ape Atoll skull climb obstacle click box overlay
- Mouse tooltips now work on the welcome screen and the full screen world map
- The multicombat icon is now movable when holding alt
- The status bars health bar is now recolored when infected by a parasite
- Timers have been added to the green Tears of Guthix streams
- The Sire stun timer now more accurately tracks when the Sire is stunned while
  already stunned
- Fix the essence teleport menu swap for Sedridor
- Fix the Charge spell timer time to be 7 minutes

Enjoy!
