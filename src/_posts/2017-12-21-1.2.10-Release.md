title: '1.2.10 Release'
description: 'New 1.2.10 release of RuneLite is out. We added many new features, like native UI, notifications and few plugin improvements.'
---

This release adds lots of new functionality to RuneLite to make the end-user
experience even better, and to compete with well established third-party
clients.

The most notable new feature is the **new UI design**. I tried to make it look as
close to the native OSRS interfaces as possible. Here is the end result:

The UI was updated for all of the current RuneLite plugins, and the new API for
it is really easy to use, so it can be used in future plugins too. An example
of plugin using the new UI api is the new **Team Capes** plugin.

The plugin is showing the amount of players wearing specific team capes
currently visible on the map, which is very useful for pking clans. Here is how
it looks in game:

Till now it was hard to check the price of item you just got as a drop
from monster, or just simply to check price of stack of your precious magic
logs in bank. That is why there were quite a few improvements to examine plugin
in the client. Now you are able to examine items and item stacks in you bank,
inventory, equipment screen or even in the Miscellania screen and it shows
Grand Exchange and High Alchemy price of that item in the game chat. Here is
small example:

![examine plugin](/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/examine-plugin.png)

To make talking to your clan mates easier, there is new clan chat plugin
that shows current ranks of every clan chat member next to his/her name.
Example:

![clan chat plugin](/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/clan-chat.png)

There were also some background changes in the client to make it work better,
fix some bugs and possibly make it faster. One of the background improvements
that is also visible to end users is the use of the native notification system,
so it now supports every Linux distribution with working notification system
and even Mac OS (with same notification support for Windows as before). Example
of the notification system in action on Arch Linux with Dunst notification
daemon:

Well, hopefully you like new release, and as usual, enjoy!
