New Twitch plugin was added that allows you to connect your chat with some specific Twitch channel.
All messages received from this channel are sent in clan chat type with prefix [Twitch] and you
can reply to messages by prefixing your message with `//`.

The [Player-owned House plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Player-owned-House) now
displays a timer for incense burners. The time per light is variable based on the lighter's
Firemaking level, so it will display a green timer while it is guaranteed to remain lit, and a
yellow timer for the estimated extra time. Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) and
[@forsco](https://github.com/forsco) for this feature.

The [Loot Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) has a new
configuration to ignore certain loot drops, which will dim these items and exclude their value from
the displayed loot value, and a toggle for whether they should appear in the loot tracker display
at all. Thanks to [@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi) for making this feature possible!

Items required for clue steps are now automatically (and implicitly) tagged "clue", and can be
searched for in the bank. Never waste time poring through your bank for the exact items you need
again! Thanks to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) for this feature.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Recent clan chat listings with spaces in their names no longer become corrupted
- Multiple marks of grace can now be highlighted while training on rooftop agility courses
- Mounted capes now prioritize Teleport and Spellbook options in a player-owned house via the menu
  entry swapper plugin
- If set, XP globes now use the ingame skill goals for displaying completion progress

Enjoy!
