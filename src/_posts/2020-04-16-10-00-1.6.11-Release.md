Overlays, such as panels and screen markers can now be resized by holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> and
dragging their edges/corners. Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for adding this
feature.

Note: The `Infobox wrap count` setting has been removed from RuneLite's config. You can resize the
infobox container to achieve the same effect, as shown below. Also, as was the case prior to this
release, you can reset an overlay's position and size using <kbd>Alt</kbd> and right-clicking the
overlay.

The [Grand Exchange plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Grand-Exchange) now has an
option to use fuzzy searching, allowing you to search abbreviations or imprecise spellings to find
items. Thanks to [@dennisdev](https://github.com/dennisdev) for this great enhancement!

The [Prayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Prayer) now has an option to replace
your prayer points display in your prayer orb with the time remaining until your prayer points
expire. Thanks to [@dekvall](https://github.com/dekvall) for this feature.

The Anti Drag plugin has been updated to remove the requirement of the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when
outside of PVP scenarios. An `On Shift Only` option has been added to the plugin, which must be
enabled to work both in and outside of PVP.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Bank searches are now more responsive with the
  [Bank plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank) active

  tooltips appear to be displaying far away from their cursor should see it display in the correct
  location now
