Overlays, such as panels and screen markers can now be resized by holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> and
dragging their edges/corners. Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for adding this
feature.

The `Infobox wrap count` setting has been removed from RuneLite's config. You can resize the
infobox container to achieve the same effect, as shown below. If you previously had `Infobox wrap count`
set to a value other than 4, you will have to alt-drag and resize the overlay to cause the infoboxes to
wrap again at the desired number. Also, as was the case prior to this release, you can reset an overlay's
position and size using <kbd>Alt</kbd> and right-clicking the overlay.

The [Grand Exchange plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Grand-Exchange) now has an
option to use fuzzy searching, allowing you to search abbreviations or imprecise spellings to find
items. Thanks to [@dennisdev](https://github.com/dennisdev) for this great enhancement!

The [Prayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Prayer) now has an option to replace
your prayer points display in your prayer orb with the time remaining until your prayer points
expire. Thanks to [@dekvall](https://github.com/dekvall) for this feature.

The Anti Drag plugin has been updated to remove the requirement of the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when
outside of PVP scenarios. An `On Shift Only` option has been added to the plugin, which must be
enabled to work both in and outside of PVP.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Bank searches are now more responsive with the
  [Bank plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank) active
- Players can no longer accidentally reposition their mouse tooltips, and players whose mouse
  tooltips appear to be displaying far away from their cursor should see it display in the correct
  location now
- Support has been added to various plugins for gilded axe and pickaxe animations
- [Clue Scrolls](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) referencing Immenizz or

  to hop into full worlds when hopping up/down

  own death with the `Screenshot Friend Deaths` option enabled

  [Camera](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Camera) plugins now display tooltips showing
  the slider value when using the ingame volume and camera zoom sliders

  the camera pitch and yaw mouse controls

  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Combat-Level)
- The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) now highlights the stick
  on the Werewolf agility course
- The [Fishing plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Fishing) properly updates its
  overlay to show that you are not fishing when you're interrupted by certain activities, such as
  level-up dialogs
- The [Quest List plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Quest-List) no longer causes
  errors when enabling it after already being logged in
- The [Loot Tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker) tracks herbiboar loot
  when your herb sack is open and has learned that potion drinking, etc., is not loot when hunting
  the herbiboar
- The [Nightmare Zone](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Nightmare-Zone) and
  [Discord](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord) plugins no longer think you are in
  the Nightmare Zone when fighting the King Black Dragon
- Slayer tasks assigned to be completed within the Jormungand's Prison are now properly recognized
  by the [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer)
- The [Run Energy plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Run-Energy) learned the new
  graceful set energy recovery mechanics from the update in January
- You are no longer considered to be "not woodcutting" by the [Woodcutting
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Woodcutting) when there is a long pause between
  logs being chopped
- The [Boosts Information plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Boosts-Information) no
  longer shows the restore overlay when it does not show any visible boosts
- The [Kourend Library plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Kourend-Library) now shows
  books which are in your inventory versus not yet found in the library in different colors in its
  side panel, and has an option to show a hint arrow pointing toward your target book
- The [Items Kept on Death plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Items-Kept-on-Death)
  learned the updated Eternal teleport crystal value

Enjoy!
