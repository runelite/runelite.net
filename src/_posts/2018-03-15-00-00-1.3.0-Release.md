swaps the left click menu options on some things.

The ground items plugin can now highlight menu options based on item price,
thanks to [@devdennis](https://github.com/devdennis).

[@abex](https://github.com/abextm) added a regen meter to the hitpoints and
special attack orbs.

The player indicator plugin can now show player names on the minimap, from
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam)

Also, thanks to [@josharoo](https://github.com/josharoo) and
[@fe-mirino](https://github.com/fe-mirino) for their work on
expanding the [wiki](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki).

The minimap plugin now has an option to allow hiding the minimap on resized mode
([@Blizik](https://github.com/Blizik))

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The xp tracker plugin has been overhauled to show more information in less
  space
- Fixed item sprites in the fishing plugin (among other places) sometimes having
  the incorrect zoom applied to them
- Opponent info overlay will now update hitpoints for opponents you recently
  were targeting
- Fix hiscore player menu option intefering with other game menu options like
  Whack
- Fix attack styles not being hidden when attack style plugin configuration is
  changed
- Add right click menu to screenshot button to open the screenshot folder
- Reposition points box in raids to be underneat the xp dropper overlay

Enjoy!
