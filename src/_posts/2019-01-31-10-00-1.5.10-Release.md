title: '1.5.10 Release'
description: 'Revamped color selector and boss personal best time chat command'
author: Jordan
---

We have written a new color selector from scratch to offer a long-time requested feature for color
picking: adjustable transparency values! This color selector now offers that functionality for the
[Cannon](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Cannon), [Ground
Marker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Ground-Markers), [Object
Marker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Object-Markers), [Tile
Indicator](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Tile-Indicators), and [XP
Globe](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Globes) plugins. Thanks to
[@psikoi](https://github.com/psikoi) and [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) for this feature!

A `!pb` chat command has been added, which displays your personal best kill time of any boss which
has a kill timer. Make sure to secure a kill on the desired boss so RuneLite can store its best
kill time to share!

The [NPC Indicators plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/NPC-Indicators) has been
updated to allow tagging of NPCs which, because of technical limitations, could not previously have
a "Tag" menu entry added, such as Menaphite Thugs. As a side effect, however, the "Tag" menu entry
will now be listed just before the NPC's "Examine" menu entry, shown below.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- A number of Kebos area hot-cold clue locations have been added to the [Clue Scroll
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll)
- The [Time Tracking plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Time-Tracking) now displays
  more conservative estimates for farming patch growth timers to avoid showing a crop as finished
  too early
- An option has been added to the [Runelite
  settings](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/RuneLite) to require Shift to be pressed for
  overlay menu options to appear. Additionally, overlay menu options will no longer be a left-click
  option when positioned over other widgets.
- An ore tracker has been added to the [Motherlode Mine
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Motherlode-Mine)
- The [World Map plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map) now adds the type of
  rare tree to the tree icon tooltips
- Upon completion, anti-venom [timers](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) will now
  add an anti-poison timer of the appropriate length
- The [Chambers of Xeric plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chambers-of-Xeric) now
  has an option to send a game message with the raid layout when entering a new raid
- The [Barrows Brothers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Barrows-Brothers) will no
  longer display minimap dots for NPCs which would not ordinarily draw one elsewhere (such as pets)
- The [Screenshot plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screenshot) now has an option to
  screenshot duel wins and losses
- When buying slayer rewards, the [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer)
  infobox will now update the points displayed in its tooltip
- A [Menu Entry Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) option
  has been added to swap "Pick" with "Pick-lots" to help you grab empty gourds faster in Chambers of
  Xeric
- A bug causing some minor render order issues in the [GPU
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU) has been fixed
- A bug causing the [Mage Training Arena
  plugin's](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mage-Training-Arena) Telekinetic room helper
  to fail has been fixed

Enjoy!
