[You've asked for
it](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c194r3/suggestion_my_rework_of_the_broken_keptondeath/),
and we're here to deliver! We have added an
[Items Kept on Death plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Items-Kept-on-Death) which
more accurately displays the items you will lose upon dying, and adds toggle buttons which simulate
certain statuses which would affect that, such as being skulled or having the Protect Item prayer
active. Thanks to [@TheStonedTurtle's](https://github.com/TheStonedTurtle) for the hard work that
went into making this possible.

**Please note** that while we have tested this with as many situations as we had access to, our
knowledge and understanding of the death mechanics may not be perfectly in line with what will occur
ingame. If you discover a situation where this interface is inaccurate, [please report such bugs on
our issue tracker.](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md) For this
reason, _this plugin is disabled by default_. Make sure to look for it and turn it on if you'd like
to try it!

The [World Map plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/World-Map) has been updated to
display quest completion states. Thanks to [@connorjclark](https://github.com/connorjclark) for
adding this feature.

In addition to the new features mentioned above, a small number of notable bugs have been fixed.

- [Object markers](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Object-Markers) for objects larger than
  one tile will no longer become duplicated. This means you should no longer see a black overlay on
  such objects, and this will no longer impact your FPS ingame.
- The [Key Remapping plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Key-Remapping) will no longer
  change your tabs when an NPC dialog is open, allowing you to properly input chat options.
- We have fixed the
  [Interface Styles plugin's](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Interface-Styles) HD
  healthbars.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [Chat Notifications plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Notifications) now
  correctly matches `<` and `>`
- [Emojis added to a message](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Emojis) will no longer reset
  the message's [chat color](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Color)
- The [Mining plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mining) now recognizes ash piles,
  has some missing and inaccurate ore timers corrected, and draws its progress pie at the proper
  height for motherlode mine and amethyst veins. In addition, it displays its progress pie in a
  different color for motherlode mine veins during the random timer of their respawn.
- Clue scrolls affected by the Hosidius rework have had their locations updated
- A coordinate clue scroll located in Weiss has been added to the
  [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll)
- The skill challenge clue scroll requiring killing a spiritual mage is now properly recognized
- The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) will now recognize
  more Falo the Bard clue scrolls
- The [Item Stats plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Stats) now has an option to
  remove the "Weight" stat from the stats tooltip
- The [Item Identification plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Identification)
  will now overlay items shown in the seed box, looting bag, and in Miscellania's collection screen
- The [Timers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) will properly add a
  teleblock timer now, since the ingame message has changed
- The [Discord plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord) will show your ingame
  status as "Training: Fishing" instead of Strength or Agility when performing barbarian fly fishing
- New flash notification options have been added to
  [RuneLite's global configuration](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/RuneLite)
- The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) now recognizes a
  previously-missing Falador rooftop agility course obstacle
- You can now configure the drag delay of the [Inventory Grid
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Inventory-Grid)
- The [Menu Entry Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) will
  now swap the "Shop" menu entry of the Witchhaven shop when the "Trade" option is enabled
- A bug in the [Item Prices plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Prices)
  preventing high alchemy profits from being displayed unless the item's high alchemy value was also
  displayed has been fixed

Enjoy!
