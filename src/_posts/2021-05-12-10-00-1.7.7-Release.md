description: 'Minor fixes and improvements'

We've had a few updates since the last blog post, mostly minor, and so this post includes those changes as well as the changes today.

The low detail plugin now has an option to hide lower floors, which is particularly useful on lower end computers in
busy areas, like the hallowed sepulchre.

The friend list plugin now has an option to show the world a player logged into on the log in message.

The item charges plugin can now show infoboxes with a charge count for braclets of slaughter, expeditious bracelets, and the chronicle.

A world region filter was added to the world switcher plugin, which causes the world hopper panel to only list worlds in a specific region.

The chat colors config has gained an additional option to allow recoloring your own username in chat.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- STASH units that you've removed items from now stay highlighted after the clue step has been completed, to remind you to deposit the items back
- When using `Lookup` from the chatbox, the hiscore plugin will now use the correct hiscores based on the ironman symbol of the player
- Items required for skill challenge clues are now found when using the `clue` bank tag
- The fishing trawler time remaining display has been updated to reflect the recent changes to the game duration
- The status bars alignment in modern resizable mode has been fixed back to its original position
- The obstacles on the way to the Rellekka lighthouse now have their clickboxes highlighted
- Tempoross and the chest in the Threatre of Blood lobby are now tracked by the loot tracker
- The Imcando hammer has been added to the idle notifier, once again allowing idle notifications when done smithing
- A `!pb tempoross` command has been added (requires getting 1 additional kill post-update)
- The spec counter has been fixed to not count bandos godsword and bandos godsword (or) specs separately
- Battlestaffs have been added to the fletching calculator
- A `Leave` swap has been added to the menu entry swapper for leaving Tempoross after a game
- A bug causing the GPU plugin to break when antialiasing is forced by the system has been fixed
- The camera plugin now has an option to keep the vertical camera position when aligning the camera to cardinal directions

Enjoy!
