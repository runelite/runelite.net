title: '1.4.10 Release'
description: 'Loot tracker, minnows overlay, prayer bar flick helper and more bug fixes'
author: Tomas

A loot tracker plugin has been added which will be able to track your loot from
 * monsters
 * bosses (like Vorkath and Zulrah)
 * completed clue scrolls
 * Chambers of Xeric
 * Theatre of Blood
 * Barrows Brothers
 * and players you PK (!)
 
For now, all these data will be tracked only per-session and not persisted and there is only per-kill view,
but we are planning to extend both these areas in future. This plugin is disabled by default, so make sure
to enable it in settings under **Loot tracker**.

This feature is result of hard work of [@WooxSolo](https://github.com/WooxSolo), [@Adam-](https://github.com/Adam-),
[@TheStonedTurtle](https://github.com/TheStonedTurtle) and [@Psikoi](https://github.com/Psikoi), so thank you all for
your great work on it:

Support for minnows timers has been added to Fishing plugin which displays countdown until minnow spot will
change. Thanks to [@jkybtw](https://github.com/jkybtw) who contributed this feature.

Flicking helper in Prayer plugin has been extended to also display in prayer bar if it is enabled thanks to 
[@forsco](https://github.com/forsco):

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

 * Ungael (Vorkath) obstacles has been added to agility plugin
 * Meyerditch obstacles has been added to agility plugin
 * Fairy ring clues will now warn about missing spade from inventory
 * Lumbridge swamp emote clue now shows correct location
 * Loading of window sidebar has been fixed, now it should not mysteriously disappear anymore
 * Dig location for Barbarian Villag Hot&Cold clue is now correct
 * Idle notifier now notify on crafting leather idle
 * Achievement diary plugin no longer thinks that you need only 61 slayer for slaying Abyssal Demons

Enjoy!
