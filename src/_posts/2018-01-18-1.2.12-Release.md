This release includes several notable features, including:

[@UniquePassive](https://github.com/UniquePassive) added overlay layers, which
allows RuneLite to optionally render beneath both the game menu and in-game
interfaces (such as the bank).

[@Noremac201](https://github.com/Noremac201) added a barbarian assult plugin
which introduces a timer until next change, and allows left-click calls.

A new cannon plugin was introduced to count the number of cannonballs left in
your cannon, thanks to [@Sethtroll](https://github.com/Sethtroll).

The new player indicators plugin will draw your friend and clanmates names:

Some improvements have been made to the attack indicator plugin to hide unwanted
attack styles instantly. Thanks to [@Dreyri](https://github.com/Dreyri) for his
work on this.

Additionally, various new AoE attacks have been added to the AoE plugin,
including Vorkath, Galvek, Vet'ion, Chaos Fanatic, and the Corporeal Beast.

Finally, the configuration panel is now more searchable with a new search bar thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam):
