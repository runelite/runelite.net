This release includes several notable features, including:

[@UniquePassive](https://github.com/UniquePassive) added a screenshot plugin,
overlay layers, which automatically takes a screen shot on level up, clue
completion, and quest completion. The screenshots may optionally be
automatically uploaded to imgur.

You may manually take a screenshot by clicking the camera icon in the titlebar:

If you enjoy the old Low Detail mode, [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam)
contributed a low detail mode plugin which lets you toggle it.

Finally, [@SomeoneWithAnInternetConnection](https://github.com/someonewithaninternetconnection)
added a metronome plugin to aid with timing game ticks.

There were also several smaller improvements, including:

- Fixed ground items overlay to correctly account for tile height when drawing item names.
- Allow plugin panels, including the configuration panel, to keep state between
  being collapsed and expanded.
- Fix idle notifier to more reliably notify you
- Fix broken glyphs which are evident on some overlays
- Add infernal eel to fishing plugin

On a more serious note, Jagex has requested removal of the Zulrah Helper,
Volcanic Mine Helper, Teamcape Overlay, and AoE Plugin for being in violation of
the game rules. These plugins have been removed.

Additionally, support for loading external plugins has been removed upon request
from Jagex.
