Lately there have been an increase in people advertising malicious websites
impersonating runelite.net, which will instead hack you. It looks like this has
been mostly in Twitch chat.

This is a reminder the only safe download is from runelite.net. The checksums
for the download are available from the official github, and the Windows binary
is digitally signed by Alexander Henne.

I sent an abuse report to one of their providers, NameCheap, over 24 hours
ago... but it does not seem to be very effective. If anyone here happens to work
at NameCheap NOC contact me.
