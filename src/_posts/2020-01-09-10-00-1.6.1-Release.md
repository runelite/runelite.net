The hiscore plugin now supports boss hiscores and shows it in a panel beneath
the minigame hiscores.

The `!kc` command remains as-is as it updates kill counts in real-time as
opposed to the boss hiscores which require relogging.

The camera plugin now has an option to add `Look South`, `Look East`, and `Look West` to the compass.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The new tag-tab button has been moved below the tag-tab list to make room
  for the new equipment button
- The cannon plugin now has a configurable threshold for when it will warn you
  for having low ammo
- Add a shift click abort GE offer option to menu swapper
- Add a menu swap for GE offer withdraw mode
- Add an option to show the total value of Chambers of Xeric loot to the raids
  plugin
- Fix slayer plugin to recognize tasks assigned to the Forthos Dungeon
- Fix clipping of 2005 interface style minimap
- Fix several more issues with the Kourend library plugin which cause it to
  reset at the wrong time and incorrectly mark objects when world hopping
- Add the option to Lookup players on your ignore list
- Add potions to the item identification plugin
- Support chat command clear line/word keybinds in pm input dialog
- Fix clan chat ranks not showing up if the clan chat name is recolored

Enjoy!
