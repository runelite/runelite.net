description: 'Custom Cursor and Item Identification plugins, Falo the Bard clue support'
author: Jordan

A Custom Cursor plugin has been added which, when enabled, allows you to change your cursor when
hovering the client to one of a number of iconic RuneScape cursors, including the RS3 gold and
silver cursors, a trout, and the iconic dragon scimitar. Thanks to
[@Kruithne](https://github.com/Kruithne) and [@Trevor159](https://github.com/Trevor159) for making
this happen!

Have you ever confused your herbs, seeds, or tree saplings? We've added an Item Identification
plugin to help combat that. When enabled, it will overlay the name (or abbreviated name) on the
item when in most non-bank interfaces. Thanks to [@Hydrox6](https://github.com/Hydrox6) for adding
this feature.

The Clue Scroll plugin has had support added for Falo the Bard clues, thanks to
[@Twiglet1022](https://github.com/Twiglet1022).

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The loot tracker plugin now tracks Herbiboar harvest loot
- When completing beginner-level music clue steps, the Clue Scroll plugin will scroll your music
  list to the requested song when first opened after reading the clue
- An option has been added to the NPC Indicators plugin to also highlight the right-click menu
  options of marked NPCs
- The Slayer plugin will now highlight Mutated Zygomites sooner when they are weak and can be
  sprayed
- The Idle Notifier plugin will now alert you should you go idle after crafting pottery
- An icon for the battlefront teleport has been added to the World Map plugin
- The Daily Task plugin now has an option to notify you when Thirus's dynamite is available for
  pick-up
- The Virtual Levels plugin now has an option to disable showing virtual total level
- Bronze darts are now shown at the proper level in the Skill Calculator plugin
- Fixed a bug which could cause the Ammo plugin's infobox to not be removed properly

Enjoy!
