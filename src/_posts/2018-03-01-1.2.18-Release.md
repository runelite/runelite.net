A grand exchange plugin has been added by
[@Someonewithaninternetconnection](https://github.com/someonewithaninternetconnection).
It shows your current grand exchange offers and their progress:

[@NotFoxtrot](https://github.com/NotFoxtrot) contributed a pyramid plunder plugin which uses a less obtrusive interface:

The camera zoom plugin has a new toggle to enable "verticle camera" which
relaxes the upper pitch limit of the camera:

Thanks to [@abextm](https://github.com/abextm) for their work on this

Finally, the cannon plugin was extended by [@SemtexError](https://github.com/SemtexError) to show the NPC double-hit spots:

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* TzTok-Jad overlay is now shown for the whole fight duration
* The puzzle solver now displays the fastest solution
* Add Dorgesh-Kaan and Brimhaven agility arenas to the agility plugin
* Show skill details on hover instead of click in the hiscore panel
* Maniacal monkeys have been added to the hunter plugin
* Hunter plugin was improved to be more accurate, and catch rate overlay was removed
* Fullscreen support has been added for OSX
* Achievement diary plugin has been removed in favour of new OSRS achievement diary interface
* World map has been fixed, no more increased memory consumption after it is closed
* Positive and negative boosts are now properly colored when using absolute boosts
* Cannonball plugin now supports unloading

Enjoy!
