The Tile Indicators plugin can now show your currently hovered tile. Thanks to
[@Deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for this feature.

The Camera Zoom plugin can now require the Control key be held down to enable zooming via the scroll
wheel. Thanks to [@MagicfTail](https://github.com/MagicfTail) for this feature.

The world map overlay has had its fairy ring icon changed to be easier on the eyes.

The Runecrafting plugin has had its pouch counter removed as the data we relied on to display that
information was removed in last week's Runecrafting pouch emptying and filling update.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- An option has been added to hide XP globes and/or XP trackers for skills which have reached level
  99
- A stamina timer will be started when you are the recipient of a dose via the Boost Potion Share
  spell
- Various clues have had their item requirements fixed
- The idle notifier will notify you when you've stopped collecting sand
- The friends list counter now correctly displays the maximum friends list capacity for members
- Obstacle highlighting has been added for the Meiyerditch entrance, the Weiss entrance, and
  the McGrubor's Woods railing
- The raids scouting overlay is now hidden when on Olm's floor
- The raids ending message default color has been improved
- Items examined within the clue scroll reward panel or smithing interface&ndash;as well as item
  placeholders within the bank&ndash;will now display their price information
- Tars, leather shields, and super antifire potions have been added to the skill calculator
- The cannon spot for ice trolls has been improved via a slight adjustment
- Timers which no longer apply will now clear themselves upon death
- Map clues will now indicate in the clue overlay if you are missing a spade in your inventory
- A Karamja diary requirement has been corrected
- The screenshot plugin can now take screenshots upon player death
- The Salty Peter clue scroll now gives you a hint on his general direction (he may still wander
  outside of view of that spot, so be sure to look out for him!)
- The slayer plugin now displays icons for all missing wilderness task monsters
- Wilderness slayer updates from the slayer gem no longer interfere with the plugin highlighting
  monsters
- The 2010 interface style has had some icon locations adjusted to be better aligned
- Chat commands now have more descriptive tooltips within the settings menu, indicating the exact
  text needed to use the command

Enjoy!
