title: '1.5.18 Release'
description: 'Quest list plugin and special attack sharing enhancement'
author: Jordan
---

A Quest List plugin has been added, which adds a button to toggle visibility of completed quests,
and adds a search button to limit the shown quests in the list. Thanks to
[@spudjb](https://github.com/spudjb) for adding this feature!

The
[Special Attack Counter plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Special-Attack-Counter)
now shares special attack hits with your party members, with this information displayed in the
tooltip.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The Bank Value plugin has been renamed to the Bank plugin, and now offers options to force
  right-clicking on the deposit inventory/worn buttons
- The XP tracker no longer resets the overall XP display when using the "Reset others" right-click
  option
- The Special Attack Counter plugin no longer tracks special attacks on other players
- The loot tracker now tracks loot obtained from the Brimstone chest
- The `!kc` chat command will now track herbiboar harvest counts

Enjoy!
