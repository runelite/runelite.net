For everyone who likes to AFK, thanks to [@Fire-Proof](https://github.com/Fire-Proof)
Nightmare Zone plugin was added. It shows your current Nightmare Zone points in nice
RuneLite custom overlay, notifies you when you are low on absorption and even when
your overload runs out.

Barrows helper has been added in a new Barrows plugin by [@Sethtroll](https://github.com/Sethtroll).
No more black minimap when in tunnels or finding the correct doors!

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

* The zoom plugin is now working again thanks to [@Abextm](https://github.com/Abextm)
* New option has been added to RuneLite settings that will make your window stay always on top
* Client is now logging the logs to ~/.runelite/logs, so in case you want to report problem,
  you can also send the logs that would help us with resolving the problem.
* POH icon's displaying when field was changed was fixed
* Slayer task now do not decrements anymore when your slayer lvl is decremented
  (for example in God wars or from KBD special attack)
* Title bar buttons are now shown in the info panel when you have custom title bar disabled

Enjoy new release!
