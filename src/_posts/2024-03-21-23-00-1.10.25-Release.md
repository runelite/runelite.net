## Varlamore

Varlamore: Part one is here! We've been working on adding a bunch of the new content to the various plugins in the last day. This includes:

- New farming patches have been added to timetracking, and to the website
- The hiscores have been updated for Colosseum Glory, Lunar chests, and Sol Heredit
- The world map plugin includes new Varlamore transports, fishing spots, trees, rocks, patches, fairy rings, hunter spots, and dungeons.
- New clues have been added to the clue scroll plugin
- Loot tracking for Lunar chest, Colosseum, and hunters loot sacks have been added
- Embertailed jerboa has been added to the hunter plugin

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- A visual bug affecting the hunter guild roof with GPU on has been fixed
- Fix the attack styles plugin to recognize the new weapon types
- Fix roof removal for the hunter guild
- Fix a bug preventing reordering of bank tag tabs on the sidebar
- The color of ground items can now be set via shift + right click on the item
- The moons of peril overlay is now movable
- A bug preventing quest states from showing on the world map has been fixed

Enjoy!
