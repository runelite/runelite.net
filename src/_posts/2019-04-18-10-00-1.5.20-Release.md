title: '1.5.20 Release'
description: 'Clue updates and world map transportation tooltips'
author: Adam

This release adds many of the new clues released last week, with only beginner
hot/cold and beginner map clues not done yet. Thanks to everyone working to get
those added.

The hiscore plugin was updated for beginner clues:

The world map plugin now adds tooltips to all transportation icons so you can
tell what kind of transportation method it is:

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Add all new anagram, cipher, coordinate, cryptic, and emote clues
- Add support for music clues, and highlighting the correct track to play
- Add new wilderness hot cold spot in the Graveyard of Shadows
- Fix the hiscore plugin looking up clues and LMS rank
- Add beginner clues to the !clues chat command
- Add beginner clues to the loot tracker
- Fix status bars plugin sometimes not correctly showing the poison background
  color
- Fix NPC aggro plugin not showing the instructions after being toggled on

An issue was fixed which prevented configuration from syncing across devices for
users with newly created RuneLite accounts (in the last 3-4 weeks). A side effect of
fixing this caused the client to wipe its configuration for these users over the
last week. Sorry about that.

Enjoy!
