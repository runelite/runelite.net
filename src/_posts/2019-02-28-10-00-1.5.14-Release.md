This weeks update is focused on improvements to the website. You can now login
on [https://runelite.net](https://runelite.net) and view details about your
RuneLite account which includes current slayer task, a boss log, the loot
tracker, and a new Grand Exchange history tracker which tracks completed trades
you have made on the GE.

**Loot tracker:**

**Account overview:**

**Grand Exchange history:**

</div>

Both the loot tracker and Grand Exchange tracker allow easily exporting their
data into JSON format. Both keep up to 1 month of history.

Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for creating the site over
the last few weeks.

The hitpoints plugin can now recolor the hitpoints icons based on the type of
poison you have:

Local RuneLite settings can now be imported into an account's settings by
clicking the Import button in the Info panel when logged in:
