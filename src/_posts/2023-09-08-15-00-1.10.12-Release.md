## Extended map loading

RuneLite now supports extended map loading, via a new setting in the `GPU plugin`. This setting controls how many additional chunks to load past what is usually the edge of the visible world. Previously your character would have to move close to the edge, within 16 tiles, before the new map area was loaded in. Now, we have increased that gap to 56 tiles!

When combined with our previous work on [seamless map loading](https://runelite.net/blog/show/2023-05-13-1.10.0-Release) the world feels like one continuous area.

When zoomed fully out, the total visible area is now up to 184x184 tiles, over three times as many as previously! The max render distance of the GPU plugin has been increased accordingly. This also fixes the black area shown on the minimap when zoomed out and near the world edge.

Note there are a few limitations:

Extended map loading does not work in instances, because there isn't a way to tell what the additional map to load is.

You also may have to do a little exploring first! RuneLite can only load areas that it has seen before.

### Scrollable menu

The right click menu is now scrollable, useful for selecting menu options which are otherwise off screen. Also remember the `Collapse ground item menu` option exists which helps with this too.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Tile and object markers now have an option to change their color in the right click menu. Object markers also can change the render style on a per-object basis via the menu.
- Attack styles can now send a chat message warning when you switched to a warned style
- A recent update by Jagex has made the client able to reload itself without fully restarting after game updates. Various bugs in plugins related to this have been fixed. Most notably issues surrounding chat icons added by plugins being incorrectly shown. We recommend restarting the client regardless, so that you will pull in the latest RuneLite version, even if it is not required.
- A bug causing boss slayer tasks to not be shown properly in `!task` or on the overlay has been fixed.
- The loot tracker now supports bounty crates
- The party plugin ping color assigned to players is now configurable
- The rune pouch overlay's runes are now pixel art instead of scaled down rune images
