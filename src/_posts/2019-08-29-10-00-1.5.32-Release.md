title: '1.5.32 Release'
description: 'Global pickpocket menu swap, Low Detail auto-reloading, screenshot to clipboard, and de-duplicated stacked fishing spots'
author: Jordan
---

The [Menu Entry Swapper plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) can
now swap the "Pickpocket" menu option with the "Talk-to" menu option for all NPCs, not just H.A.M
members. (With the exception of NPCs who can be blackjacked)

The [Low Detail plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Low-Detail) will now reload your
current scene when toggled on or off to apply the changes immediately without requiring a re-log.

The [Screenshot plugin's](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screenshot) _Upload_ setting
now allows you to optionally copy the screenshot image to your clipboard when taken. Thanks to
[@Alexsuperfly](https://github.com/Alexsuperfly) for this contribution.

The [Fishing plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Fishing) no longer draws duplicate
sprites for stacked fishing spots of the same type.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- The [Boosts Information plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Boosts-Information) can
  now toggle displaying combat/non-combat/both boosts
- Examining items found in the seed box will now trigger the [Examine
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Examine)
- The overlay renderer now shows drag outlines at their proper locations again
- The [Slayer plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) correctly recognizes Lizard
  and Vampyre tasks
- The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) saw multiple
  fixes, correcting some STASH unit locations, fixing a Song of the Elves-related clue, fixing some
  clue items showing no names, and added some item variants to some item sets
- The text of a Western Provinces diary step has been updated in the [Diary Requirements
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Diary-Requirements) after a change since the
  release of the Song of the Elves quest
- The white pixels which appeared at the edges of game objects for some players while using MSAA
  with the [GPU plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU) have been exterminated
- The [Death Indicator plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Death-Indicator) will
  correctly recognize when players die when respawning in Prifddinas
- Braindeath Island now has a [skybox](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skybox) color
- Corrections have been made in the [Items Kept on Death
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Items-Kept-on-Death) to show correct values of
  Avernic defenders and Salve amulet (ei)s.

Enjoy!
