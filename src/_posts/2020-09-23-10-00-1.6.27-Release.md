Item outlines [like those seen when using the Inventory Tags
plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Inventory-Tags) have been updated to draw more
accurate borders around the outlined items.

Several bugs preventing RuneLite from maximizing correctly on hidpi or scaled displays have been
fixed, and there will be an upcoming launcher release to fix the remaining known issues, which are
related to multiple displays with mixed hidpi/scaling settings.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Load times with the [GPU plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU) enabled have been
  slightly improved
- A "Plugin Hub" search suggestion has been added to the plugin list panel to help identify plugins
  added via the hub
- The [Mining plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mining) now tracks dense essence
  mining and shows the proper mining status while mining at Motherlode mine and while mining
  amethyst
- The [Motherlode Mine plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Motherlode-Mine) shows the
  proper mining status while mining with a 3rd Age pickaxe
- The [Discord plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord) now recognizes many more
  areas such as the Farming Guild, runecrafting altars, Morytania, and more
- The [Clue Scroll plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) correctly
  indicates that items protected with a Trouver parchment are eligible for emote clues
- Blisterwood logs, Hallowed Sepulchre floors, and the Carpenter's outfit set bonus have been added
  to the [Skill Calculator plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skill-Calculator)
- You can now toggle the Dark energy core highlight in the [Corporeal Beast
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Corporeal-Beast)
- The new Gu'Tanoth agility shortcut is now highlighted with the [Agility
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility)
- Houses decorated with the Twisted League or Hosidius themes now have their own [skybox
  colors](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skybox)
- The [Abyssal Sire stun timer](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) shows up correctly
  again
- [The Inferno's time tracker](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) is now adjusted by 6
  seconds to be in line with the ingame timer

Enjoy!
