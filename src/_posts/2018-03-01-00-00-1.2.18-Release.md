A grand exchange plugin has been added by
[@Someonewithaninternetconnection](https://github.com/someonewithaninternetconnection).
It shows your current grand exchange offers and their progress:

[@NotFoxtrot](https://github.com/NotFoxtrot) contributed a pyramid plunder plugin which uses a less obtrusive interface:

Finally, the cannon plugin was extended by [@SemtexError](https://github.com/SemtexError) to show the NPC double-hit spots:

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- TzTok-Jad overlay is now shown for the whole fight duration
- The puzzle solver now displays the fastest solution
- Add Dorgesh-Kaan and Brimhaven agility arenas to the agility plugin
- Show skill details on hover instead of click in the hiscore panel
- Maniacal monkeys have been added to the hunter plugin
- Hunter plugin was improved to be more accurate, and catch rate overlay was removed
- Fullscreen support has been added for OSX
- Achievement diary plugin has been removed in favour of new OSRS achievement diary interface
- World map has been fixed, no more increased memory consumption after it is closed
- Positive and negative boosts are now properly colored when using absolute boosts
- Cannonball plugin now supports unloading

Enjoy!
