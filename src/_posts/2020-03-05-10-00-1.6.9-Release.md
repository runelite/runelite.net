title: '1.6.9 Release'
description: 'Bank tag tabs tab and screenshot sub-folders'
author: Jordan

The [Bank Tags plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank-Tags) has a new right-click
menu option of the "New tag tab" button which will display each of your tag tabs as bank items,
letting you quickly view and reorganize them. In addition, reordering tag tabs respects your bank
rearrange mode selection. Thanks to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) for these features!

The [Screenshot plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screenshot) now stores all
automatic screenshots in sub-folders according to the screenshot type, such as Levels, Quests,
Boss Kills, Valuable Drops, Pets, and more. Thanks to [@gregg1494](https://github.com/gregg1494)
and [@Nightfirecat](https://github.com/nightfirecat) for adding this feature.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- [Plugin Hub plugins](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Information-about-the-Plugin-Hub)
  are now sorted by display name and are ordered in a more useful way when searched
- RuneLite now records your boss kill count and personal bests for the [Chat Commands
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Chat-Commands) when reading your POH
  adventurer's log
- The [Item Charges plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Charges) now shows
  charges for your amulets of bounty and amulets of chemistry
- Numerous hot-cold clues have had their locations made more precise to improve the [Clue Scroll
  plugin's](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) narrowing feature
- Following the recent game update, the [Clue Scroll
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Clue-Scroll) now understands ornamented items
  fulfill emote clue requirements in the same way their un-ornamented versions do
- Mouse tooltips no longer go off-screen or overlap the mouse cursor when using the "Above cursor"
  option
- Mounted Mythical capes now display an icon with the [Player-owned House
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Player-owned-House)
- A bug making it difficult to manually type new values into config text boxes with unit suffixes
  has been fixed
- The [Item Stats](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Stats) equipment bonus tooltips no
  longer confuse the attack speed difference for the attack stab difference
- Drift net rewards are now tracked in the [Loot Tracker
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Loot-Tracker)
- The [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility) now uses [your ingame
  goal](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Drop#goals) to determine laps to level
- Your [active slayer task](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Slayer) is canceled when you
  leave the Inferno
- Guthix rests now have their xp values displayed in the [Skill Calculator
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Skill-Calculator)
- Impling jars can now be labeled by the [Item Identification
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Item-Identification)
- The [Mining plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Mining) learned the respawn times of
  Weiss salts
- The [Report Button plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Report-Button) can now show
  your login time as a measure of game ticks

Enjoy!
