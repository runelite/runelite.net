description: 'Challenge clues, splash screen, and loot tracker improvements'
author: Adam

The loot tracker now has collapsible loot boxes, and can also track loot from the Kingdom of Miscellania

The clue plugin now supports Sherlock challenge clues

A loading splash screen was added which shows the client load progress when it
is starting. It also includes better error handling, so if the client fails to
start it will show a prompt with the reason and possible resolution steps.

A launcher release is planned soon to include a similar themed loading screen,
and the improved error handling.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix wasd camera sometimes blocking messages from being sent
- Updated the XP tracker to try to account for offline xp gain (from eg. mobile)
  and not factor it into XP/hr
- Add the remaining new SotE clue steps
- Update Prifddinas course xp rates
- Add four dose stamina to herblore calculator
- Add Dragon bolts to skill calculator
- Add ferrets to the hunter plugin
- Add arrow fletching to idle notifier
- Add Isafdar tripwire to agility shortcuts
- Add Sarachnis task to the slayer plugin
- Fix items on death plugin values for repairable untradeables
- Add volcanic mine entrance to menu entry swapper
- Fix a bug causing the attack styles plugin to not hide attack styles properly
  for certain weapon switches
- Fix loot tracker loot loading on startup to place newer loot at the top
- Fix mining plugin respawn timers in the wilderness resource area, and on Miscellania
- Add Trollweiss Mountain Cave agility shortcut
- Fix camera effects from drunkenness and the fishing trawler with the GPU
  plugin
- Fix bug causing bank tag tabs to sometimes not automatically reopen when the
  bank is opened
- Fix clipping of world map tooltips
- Add divine potions to item stats plugin

We are aware of the client pauses common in the demonic gorilla cavern. Some
optimization work has gone into this release which should reduce the frequency
of the pauses. We hope this combined with the upcoming launcher release, which
includes a newer version of Java with increased performance characteristics,
will solve this issue for most players.

Enjoy!
