title: '1.6.0 Release'
description: 'RuneLite Plugin Hub'
author: Adam
---

We've added support for external plugins to RuneLite. External plugins are
plugins which are maintained by community members and other developers that are not
officially affiliated with the project.

The external plugins are verified by us for safety, to ensure they are not
malicious, and are also not breaking [Jagex's
rules](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1),
which we have agreed to as a project.

We are providing the platform for the external plugins; developers submit their
plugins to the [plugin hub repository](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub)
for inclusion. External plugins are not tied to specific RuneLite releases;
plugins can be created, modified, or removed from the plugin hub without
requiring us make a new RuneLite release.

The plugin hub can be browsed in the client by scrolling to the bottom of the
configuration panel.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix the Kourend Library plugin incorrectly resetting when searching empty bookcases
- Add support for ignore list notes to the friend notes plugin
- The fog at the scene corners now curves around it slightly
- Fix the tithe farm overlay to be movable again

Enjoy!
