An object marker plugin which lets you mark most game objects by holding shift
and right clicking was added.

The xp tracker plugin now shows intermediate progress markers for each level, if
you have a goal set which spans multiple levels.

  which was most noticible in the herbiboar area

- Add wilderness cannon spots to cannon plugin
- Add Flax and Bonemeal options to Daily Task plugin
- Add weiss agilility obstacles
- Add farming patch type to tooltips on world map
- Add barbarian mix timers to Timers plugin
- Improve performance of full screen overlays with GPU on (zammy godwards, underwater, etc.)

Enjoy!
