The loot tracker now remembers loot between client sessions if you are logged in
with a RuneLite account.

An object marker plugin which lets you mark most game objects by holding shift
and right clicking was added.

The xp tracker plugin now shows intermediate progress markers for each level, if
you have a goal set which spans multiple levels.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix FPS loss from clickbox calculation introduced in the previous release
  which was most noticeable in the herbiboar area
- Add Chaos Altar to Prayer calculator
- Add wilderness cannon spots to cannon plugin
- Add Flax and Bonemeal options to Daily Task plugin
- Add weiss agility obstacles
- Add farming patch type to tooltips on world map
- Add barbarian mix timers to Timers plugin
- Improve performance of full screen overlays with GPU on (zammy godwars, underwater, etc.)

Enjoy!
