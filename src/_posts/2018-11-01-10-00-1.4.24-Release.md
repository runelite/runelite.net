description: 'Stretched resizable mode, bank tags and shift-click for item charges and variations'

The [Stretched Mode plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Stretched-Mode) (formerly
known as the Stretched Fixed Mode plugin) now supports stretching the game in resizable mode,
effectively allowing UI scaling. Thanks to [@devLotto](https://github.com/devLotto) for adding this
feature!

You can now tag and un-tag all variations of an item, e.g. all dosages of a particular type of
potion, all charges of an Amulet of Glory, or all degraded states of a Barrows equipment piece or
piece of crystal equipment, etc. To do so, drag the item onto a tag tab while holding Shift, or add
"\*" to the end of the tag. Thanks to [@raiyni](https://github.com/raiyni) and
[@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for developing this feature.

Shift-click configuration now applies to all variations and charges of items too in very similar way as
new bank tab improvements do. This means that some previous shift-click configuration on affected items
will be reset. Thanks to [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for implementing this.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Some clue scrolls will display less text in their panels to take up less space
- Added Abyssal Bracelet charge tracking
- The Slayer plugin will no longer desync when slaying Grotesque Guardians with the Double Trouble
  reward active
- Chopping sullicep mushrooms now activates the woodcutting plugin

Enjoy!
