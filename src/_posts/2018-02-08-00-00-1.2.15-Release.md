An agility plugin has been added which shows the click boxes of ability obstaces.
Thanks to [@SomeoneWithAnInternetConnection](https://github.com/someonewithaninternetconnection)
for their hard work on reversing the clickbox calculations and making this happen.

[Discord Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) support has been
added in a new Discord plugin from [@deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam).
It will show what skill you are training in game as your discord status.

Additionally, abyss rift locations and player owned house locations are now
marked on the minimap thanks to [@Sethtroll](https://github.com/sethtroll).

There are also several smaller improvements, including:

- The screenshot plugin now has configuration for the auto screenshot of
  levelups and rewards
- There is now an option to overlay non-clan members in the player indicator
  plugin
- Theoretical boosts have been added to the item stats plugin
- Indicators have been added for stat boots as an alternative to the current
  overlay
- Fix sometimes drawing overlays at the wrong height above players and npcs
- Don't enable low memory mode on the audio subsystem when the client is
  configured in low memory mode, so the sounds sound normal
- The teamcape plugin has been readded
