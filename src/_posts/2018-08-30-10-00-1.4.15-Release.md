Run energy plugin was added thanks to [@seandewar](https://github.com/seandewar). This plugin will show tooltip with
your current weight, how much run time you have remaining and how much time it will take until your run energy fully
regens. Also it has optional setting for displaying remaining run seconds instead of run percentage in the run energy
bar.

Thanks to work of [@forsco](https://github.com/forsco) and [@Adam-](https://github.com/Adam-) friend and ignore list
counter has been added, that will simply show max amount and used amount of friends/ignored players in the respective
interfaces.

[@ItsSebas](https://github.com/ItsSebas) improved team capes plugin interface to display team cape icons with counts
instead of text in panel. This new design should be more compact and less intrusive than old one (and also looks way
better!).

The world hopper plugin now has support for hopping to people in chat via right-click menu thanks to
[@Retoxified](https://github.com/Retoxified):

![hopto](/img/blog/1.4.15-Release/hopto.png)

Loose railing shortcut near Tree Gnome Village highlighting has been added to agility plugin thanks to 
[@ItsSebas](https://github.com/ItsSebas):

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

 * The idle notifier plugin has been significantly improved, now it should not throw false warnings while
   in combat or when doing activity that is using same animations as some of the animations that display
   idle warning
 * Barrows kill count chat message will now properly update the !kc data
 * Time tracking plugin now also has "Special patches" in the overview tab
 * Teleblock timers are now removed on logout
 * Corp plugin now has option to hide the damage overlay
 * "Pause all" menu option has been added to XP tracker right-click menu

Enjoy!
