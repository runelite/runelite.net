description: 'Loot beams and pets chat command'
author: Jordan

Options have been added to the Ground Items plugin to draw loot beams for highlighted items, and for
items at or above a given price tier.

A new command, `!pets`, has been added to the Chat Commands plugin, which will display the number of
pets owned along with an icon of each pet owned. You must first check the `All pets` section of your collection
log for RuneLite to learn which pets you have. Additional pets are automatically added if the collection log unlock
notifications are enabled in the game settings.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- An option has been added to the Status Bars plugin to hide them while outside of combat
- The Report Button plugin can now display idle time on the report button
- The Menu Entry Swapper plugin's "Quick Pass/Open/Start/Travel" swap now swaps Zulrah's sacrificial
  boat's Quick-board option
- Teleport scrolls are now given labels via the Item Identification plugin
- The Timers plugin now shows a timer for being stunned while pickpocketing
- A number of locations have had their roof removal mapping improved. No more random roof pieces
  floating in the air!
- Clue scrolls requiring you travel through the Mos Le'Harmless Cave no longer prompt you to bring
  a light source when you've already built and lit the Fire of Eternal Light there
- The Time Tracking overview panel is no longer blocked from opening when your farming contract crop
  is dead

Enjoy!
