This post covers both releases.</p>\\n<p>The Leagues hiscore lookup has been replaced now with the newly opened Deadman\\ntournament, and the various lookup commands in game now recognize the Deadman\\ntournament worlds and will look up the correct hiscores for them.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/img/blog/1.6.13-Release/hiscores.png\\\" alt=\\\"hiscores\\\"></p>\\n<p>Divine Bastion and Battlemage potions have had timers added, and have been added\\nto the items stats and item identification plugins.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/img/blog/1.6.13-Release/divine.png\\\" alt=\\\"divine\\\"></p>\\n<p>If you use Windows or Linux and the GPU plugin does not work correctly for you,\\nthere is a new option in the GPU plugin you can disable called <code>Compute Shaders</code>\\nwhich may help. This drops the minimum required OpenGL version to 4.0, and uses\\nless GPU memory and compute, at the cost of being unable to extend the draw\\ndistance. Despite this limitation it still gives a noticible performance\\nimprovement and may be beneifical to users on older systems. Note that the\\noption must be toggled off <em>prior</em> to the plugin starting to take effect.</p>\\n<p>Users using Mac OSX will be happy to know that progress has been made on an OSX\\nGPU rasterizer that works as described above, due to the limited support of\\nOpenGL on OSX, and that I expect to have it added to a release in the coming\\nweeks.</p>\\n<p>The XP updater plugin can now send xp update requests to\\n<a href=\\\"https://wiseoldman.net/\\\" native=\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Wise Old Man</a>, a new xp tracker created by\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/psikoi/\\\" native=\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">@psikoi</a> - who you may remember from the\\n<a href=\\\"https://runelite.net/blog/show/2018-05-24-1.4.0-Release\\\" native=\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">obsidian theme</a>, and\\nhas been a contributor to this project for years.
