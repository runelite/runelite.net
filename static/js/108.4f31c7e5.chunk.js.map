I don't think the majority of MES fit into this\\ncategory, although the <code>Bury</code> and <code>Pickpocket</code> swap probably would.</p>\\n<p>I am trying to get further clarification from Jagex first before I make any wide\\nsweeping decisions on where to draw the line at between acceptable and not\\nacceptable with regard to menu swapping because I understand how QOL much of it\\nis to so many users.
