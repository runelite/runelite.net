I have agreed on a 1-2 day halt on\ndevelopment pending further discussion, and I have closed sourced the\ndeobfuscator and the deobfuscated RuneScape client. RuneLite is allowed to\noperate during this time.</p>\n<p>The new OSBuddy API that has been announced is also a nice step forward. The two\nclients become not too dissimilar at that point, both with a closed API\nimplementation.</p>\n<p>What this means for developers is you must rely on our exposed API and are no\nlonger able to extend or modify it. This limits development some certainly but\nit is what we must do.</p>\n<p>The closed sourced components are both build-time and update-time tools, and are\nnot artifacts shipped to the end user. So, the level of difficulty required for\nsomeone to independently prove that a given build of RuneLite is safe (eg. not\ngoing to hack you) is approximately the same as before, and still certainly very\npossible.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it gets better from here...</p>\n<p>- Adam</p>\n"}}}]);
