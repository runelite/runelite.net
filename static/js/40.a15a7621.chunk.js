I have no\nissue working with Jagex to remove parts of it from the public eye if requested.\nI would also have no issue shutting down the entire client if all 3rd party\nclients were banned. However, I do have an issue with shutting down the entire\nclient while OSBuddy is allowed to operate.</p>\n<p>While I agree that RuneLite does threaten the integrity of the game, what\nthreatens it even more is that I have to <em>buy</em> OSBuddy in order to gain the same\ncompetitive advantages of other players in game. RuneLite exists to try and\nlevel the playing field as to who can develop on the client, of which I think it\nhas done well.</p>\n<p>Jagex, please work with me here instead of singling us out. We love the game,\nand have great respect for you, but this is not an acceptable way of dealing\nwith the third party clients.</p>\n<p>If anyone within the community happens to be a (copyright) lawyer, please\ncontact me.</p>\n<p>- Adam</p>\n"}}}]);
