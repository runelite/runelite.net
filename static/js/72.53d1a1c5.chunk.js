When enabled, the GPU plugin gives improved\nframerate, particularly on larger screens, and increases the distance you can\nsee in game. Check out this <a href="https://twitter.com/RuneLiteClient/status/1062440996401790977" native="" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> for some neat pictures.</p>\n<p>The GPU plugin requires Windows (7, 8, or 10), a GPU with support for OpenGL\n4.3 or newer, and 2GB of VRAM. This requires either an Nvidia GeForce 400 or newer,\nan AMD Radeon HD 5000 Series or newer, or Intel HD Graphics with an Intel Haswell\nprocessor or newer. Also ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date.</p>\n<p>We have tested this plugin a lot over the last few weeks, on as much hardware as\nwe can find, but there are possibly configurations it does not work correctly\non. In particular, we recommend you do not enable it in dangerous situations\ningame (HCIM!) until you sufficiently test that it is stable on your system.</p>\n<p>If you find an issue with it open a bug report on our <a href="https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues" native="" rel="nofollow">issue\ntracker</a> if a bug report for it\nisn\'t already in the <a href="https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3Agpu" native="" rel="nofollow">list of known issues</a>.\nNote that currently the GPU plugin does not work with the stretched mode plugin.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>- Adam</p>\n'}}}]);
