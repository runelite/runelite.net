What Jagex did was clearly a great injustice.</p>\n<p>It is unfortunate the only way I seem to be able to have any meaningful\ndiscussion with Jagex is via loud blog posts.</p>\n<p>I have read the <a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-client-update?oldschool=1" native="" rel="nofollow">Third Party Client\nUpdate</a>\nand it contains some new details to me. Specifically, the &quot;sharing\nof tools used to deobfuscate Old School RuneScape code, and then re-publishing\nsaid code.&quot;.</p>\n<p>So, I have stripped the aforementioned tools and RuneScape client from GitHub. I\nwill be removing the other distributions off of the server shortly.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this means now RuneLite will be only partially-open source.\nRuneLite is BSD-2 licensed and the license permits me to do this. This will\nhinder new contributions some in that they cannot learn of and create new APIs\nfor client access, but we already have a well established API which can be used\nin the majority of cases.</p>\n<p>I don\'t really agree with some of the reasoning behind this, bots have existed\nbefore RuneLite existed, and I\'m sure some of them have a better knowledge of\nthe game than I do, but if it must be taken down, then okay.</p>\n<p>Regarding &quot;The conversation with RuneLite is part of the long-term strategy and\napproach for all 3rd party clients and the future of our own official client.&quot;,\nas started in the initial post, I have no problem shutting down\nRuneLite if all third party clients are to be shut down. But I will not shut it\ndown with the other clients still running.</p>\n<p>Jagex, if you have objections to any other aspect of RuneLite, I would prefer if\nyou contacted me and told me about it, instead of threatening me to take down the\nentire project. I have no problem working with you to address any concerns.</p>\n<p>There is a large portion of RuneLite code that Jagex definitely has no claim over,\nand it belongs to me, and to the many contributors to the project, and I think\nit is wrong for you to claim it must all be removed.</p>\n<p>- Adam</p>\n'}}}]);
