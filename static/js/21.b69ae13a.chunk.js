We added many new features, like native UI, notifications and few plugin improvements.",author:"Tomas",body:'<p>This release adds lots of new functionality to RuneLite to make the end-user\nexperience even better, and to compete with well established third-party\nclients.</p>\n<p>The most notable new feature is the <strong>new UI design</strong>. I tried to make it look as\nclose to the native OSRS interfaces as possible. Here is the end result:</p>\n<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/native-ui.png" alt="native ui"></p>\n<p>The UI was updated for all of the current RuneLite plugins, and the new API for\nit is really easy to use, so it can be used in future plugins too. An example\nof plugin using the new UI api is the new <strong>Team Capes</strong> plugin.</p>\n<p>The plugin is showing the amount of players wearing specific team capes\ncurrently visible on the map, which is very useful for pking clans. Here is how\nit looks in game:</p>\n<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/team-cape.png" alt="team capes plugin"></p>\n<p>Till now it was hard to check the price of item you just got as a drop\nfrom monster, or just simply to check price of stack of your precious magic\nlogs in bank. That is why there were quite a few improvements to examine plugin\nin the client. Now you are able to examine items and item stacks in you bank,\ninventory, equipment screen or even in the Miscellania screen and it shows\nGrand Exchange and High Alchemy price of that item in the game chat. Here is\nsmall example:</p>\n<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/examine-plugin.png" alt="examine plugin"></p>\n<p>To make talking to your clan mates easier, there is new clan chat plugin\nthat shows current ranks of every clan chat member next to his/her name.\nExample:</p>\n<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/clan-chat.png" alt="clan chat plugin"></p>\n<p>There were also some background changes in the client to make it work better,\nfix some bugs and possibly make it faster. One of the background improvements\nthat is also visible to end users is the use of the native notification system,\nso it now supports every Linux distribution with working notification system\nand even Mac OS (with same notification support for Windows as before). Example\nof the notification system in action on Arch Linux with Dunst notification\ndaemon:</p>\n<p><img src="/img/blog/1.2.10-Release/native-notifications.png" alt="native notifications"></p>\n<p>Well, hopefully you like new release, and as usual, enjoy!</p>\n<p>~ Tomas</p>\n<h3>New commits</h3>\n<p>We had 9 contributors this release!
