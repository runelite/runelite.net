When looking up an item on the wiki, you will now see a <code>View Real-time Prices</code> button, which, using trades made through RuneLite, will provide a much more accurate representation of the item\'s current price.</p>\n<p><img src="/img/blog/wiki-ge-partnership/prices.png" alt="prices"></p>\n<p>These new prices are updated every few minutes, which is much more frequent than the current Grand Exchange price data, which can be a day or two out of date.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with this, the Wiki is providing an API for the real-time price data for developers for free. If you are a developer and have a project or website that uses Grand Exchange price data, check out their API docs <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices" native="" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We will be updating RuneLite soon to use this data as a source for item pricing, so features such as examining items and bank value will also be more accurate.</p>\n<p>- Adam</p>\n',image:"/img/blog/wiki-ge-partnership/prices.png"}}}]);
