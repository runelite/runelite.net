We have no way to determine how many of those users enabled the <code>Add to history</code> option allowing the exploitable behavior.</p>\n<p>We raised the issue to Jagex, and provided to them the IPs of the players who we think could be affected. A staff member briefly took a look at the possibly affected accounts on Saturday, did not find anything requiring immediate attention, and has promised to look into it this week. I hope that they will be able to take corrective action if any compromised accounts are found.</p>\n<p>We have also checked all existing plugin hub plugins and found no other plugins with similarly exploitable code.</p>\n<p>To prevent this from happening again in the future, we will be automatically flagging plugins which use potentially dangerous APIs that can allow command injection, to require them to be more closely scrutinized.</p>\n<p>- Adam</p>\n"}}}]);
